 A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT
 IN DECEMBER AUTO LOANS INCREASED BY TWO POINT FIVE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ELEVEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
 CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT
 A FED ECONOMIST SUGGESTED THIS LARGE INCREASE MAY REFLECT SLOWER GROWTH EARLIER IN THE YEAR AS CONSUMERS USED HOME EQUITY LOANS TO PAY OFF CREDIT CARD BALANCES
 ALL THE INCREASES ARE SEASONALLY ADJUSTED
 BUT HE IS BULLISH ON THE ECONOMY
 REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE SEE IN THE MARKET THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE SEEMS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE MARKET HE SAID
 WHEN I LEAVE THE OFFICE AND GET HOME I'M NOT AS CONCERNED WHEN I TALK TO THE NEIGHBORS
 WHILE CHRONICLING THE DOINGS OF THE HIGHFALUTIN MAY SEEM LIGHT STUFF TO SOME MR. REVSON SAYS HIS OWN APPROACH TO THE SUBJECT MATTER ISN'T
 IT ISN'T JUST THROWING TOGETHER A STRING OF NAMES AND SAYING THEY SIPPED CHAMPAGNE ATE CAVIAR AND WORE BILL BLASS THE COLUMNIST SAYS
 FACTS ARE IMPORTANT
 IF YOU SAY SOMEONE IS WEARING A RED TIE THEN HE SHOULD BE WEARING A RED TIE
 NET FOR THE PERIOD WAS AIDED BY THE DECLINE IN THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR MR. EXLEY SAID
 ON THE OTHER HAND A TWENTY FOUR PERCENT RISE IN SPENDING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WAS A LIMITING FACTOR ON PROFIT IN THE LATEST QUARTER
 HE SAID THE COMPANY WILL ALSO HAVE AN INCREASE IN R. AND D. SPENDING FOR THE FULL YEAR BUT LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR PERCENT
 BUT THE STRONG RESULTS AREN'T EXPECTED ACROSS THE INDUSTRY SAID HELANE BECKER AIRLINE ANALYST AT SHEARSON LEHMAN HUTTON INCORPORATED
 IT'S GOING TO BE UNIQUE TO AMERICAN AND DELTA AIR LINES SHE SAID
 BOTH CARRIERS BENEFITED TO SOME EXTENT FROM LABOR AND REGULATORY TROUBLES AT TEXAS AIR CORPORATION'S EASTERN AIRLINES SHE SAID
 DELTA COMPETES WITH EASTERN IN TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CITY PAIR MARKETS AND AMERICAN IN TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED
 DELTA IS EXPECTED TO REPORT ITS RESULTS NEXT WEEK
 ECONOMISTS SAID THE LOSSES SUGGEST THRIFTS WERE STILL TAKING LARGE WRITE DOWNS OF SOUTHWESTERN REAL ESTATE
 MR. BARTH WHO HAS BEEN EXPECTING S. AND L. WRITE OFFS TO DECLINE CONCEDED HE HAD HOPED TO SEE LESS CAPITAL EROSION IN THE FIRST QUARTER
 MR. OBRINSKY SAID TEXAS REAL ESTATE IS TAKING LONGER TO RECOVER THAN MANY HAD HOPED AND OTHERS HAD EXPECTED
 SHARON ZIEMIAN ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT PRECIOUS METALS AT CITICORP'S CITIBANK N. A. NEW YORK OBSERVED THAT YESTERDAY'S MARKET REFLECTED CONFUSION
 WHILE INFLATION FEARS ABOUND INFLATION ITSELF IS HARD TO ACTUALLY PIN DOWN SHE SAID
 THIS CREATES THE WORRY THAT IF INTEREST RATES ARE RAISED IN ORDER TO COMBAT INFLATION THE FRAGILITY OF THE ECONOMY COULD BRING ABOUT A RECESSION
 BUT IT WAS BECOMING APPARENT TO EVERYONE THAT THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT RECESSION WAS NOT TO BE
 THE FED FIRST PULLED OUT SOME OF THE BASE THAT IT HAD PUMPED IN DURING JANUARY BUT THEN IT WAS OFF TO THE RACES AGAIN
 NOW THERE IS A WIDESPREAD FEAR THAT WE MAY BE HEADING INTO AN INFLATIONARY BOOM AND MR. GREENSPAN SAYS THE FED IS TIGHTENING UP
 IT'S TRUE THAT THE AGENCY HAS PERMITTED A RISE IN THE FED FUNDS RATE THE FEE CHARGED ON RESERVES BANKS LEND TO ONE ANOTHER
 BUT SO FAR THERE IS NO SIGN THAT IT IS SLOWING THE GROWTH OF MONEY
 THE DECISION TO INTERRUPT THE OLYMPIC COVERAGE COULD MEAN A POTENTIAL ADVERTISING REVENUE LOSS OF EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS ACCORDING TO MICHAEL GARTNER PRESIDENT OF N. B. C. NEWS
 THE DEBATES WOULDN'T BE INTERRUPTED BY ADS
 AFTER SOME SECOND GUESSING ON THEIR EARLIER DECISION TO SKIP THE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE MR. GARTNER SAID NETWORK OFFICIALS CHANGED THEIR MINDS YESTERDAY
 EIGHT MILLION BUCKS ISN'T SOMETHING YOU WANT TO KISS AWAY BUT YOU SWALLOW HARD AND DO WHAT YOU THINK IS RIGHT MR. GARTNER SAID
 CHEMICAL'S TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES INCORPORATED UNIT REPORTED PROFIT OF SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS
 THAT FIGURE INCLUDES A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM INTERCOMPANY INCOME TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE CORPORATION'S TAX SHARING AGREEMENT
 IN THE YEAR AGO QUARTER TEXAS COMMERCE HAD A LOSS OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE FROM THE RESTRUCTURING

 I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS
 THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY
 THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL
 THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER
 THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES
 BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM
 ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES
 AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS
 IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE
 SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON
 MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS
 SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY
 SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA
 SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS
 WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES
 CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE

 TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND
 LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION
 BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING
 SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT
 WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION
 THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION

 WHOEVER HE IS HE WILL HAVE HIS HANDS FULL OF PROBLEMS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC
 THE GOVERNMENT'S FINANCES CRY OUT FOR A STRONG PRESIDENT TO GRAPPLE WITH THEM AND TO PERSUADE A CHAOTIC CONGRESS TO ACCEPT HIS PROGRAM
 ALL OVER THE WORLD THERE ARE KNOTTY PROBLEMS FOR THE U. S. FROM LATIN AMERICA NICARAGUA AND PANAMA TO THE MIDDLE EAST
 OUR PRESIDENCY IS NOT JUST A CEREMONIAL OFFICE ITS DEMANDS ARE SUCH AS TO TRY ANY MAN'S SPIRIT INTELLIGENCE AND POLITICAL SKILL
 IN CONGRESS THE TOP TRADE NEGOTIATORS HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS CHAIRMAN DAN ROSTENKOWSKI D.
 ILLINOIS AND SENATE FINANCE CHAIRMAN LLOYD BENTSEN D.
 TEXAS WANT A TRADE BILL THAT WILL BECOME LAW RATHER THAN A POLITICAL VEHICLE IN AN ELECTION YEAR
 THEY HAVE SOUGHT THE OPINIONS OF ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS BUT THEY SAY THEY WILL FIGHT FOR A SUBSTANTIVE RATHER THAN SYMBOLIC PIECE OF LEGISLATION
 THAT GROWTH CAME IN RESPONSE TO A DECLINE IN INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND HALF WHICH PROMPTED A FLOOD OF MORTGAGE APPLICATIONS
 IT ALSO REFLECTED GOVERNMENT MEASURES TO STIMULATE DOMESTIC SPENDING
 THE HOUSING BOOM IN TURN TRIGGERED HEAVY CONSUMER SPENDING ON HOUSEHOLD GOODS WHICH AIDED THE STRONG SECOND HALF ECONOMIC EXPANSION

 COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DENNIS PATRICK HOWEVER SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT STATIONS ON CABLE SYSTEMS AS LONG AS THEY WERE POPULAR
 MR. PATRICK ALSO SAID THAT ONE ORIGINAL CONCERN THAT NETWORK OWNERSHIP MIGHT IMPEDE THE GROWTH OF CABLE AS A COMPETITOR OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE
 HOUSEHOLDS WITH CABLE T. V. HAVE INCREASED TO MORE THAN FORTY MILLION FROM ABOUT TEN MILLION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX
 IN JULY MULTIFAMILY UNIT STARTS ROSE EIGHTEEN POINT SEVEN PERCENT
 THIS INDUSTRY HAS BEEN IN THE DOLDRUMS FOR MUCH OF THE YEAR BECAUSE OF HIGH VACANCY RATES AND CHANGES IN THE TAX LAWS

 THE STORES ARE IN DENVER AND IN PHOENIX AND TUCSON ARIZONA

 IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT

 WHERE DO YOU GO AROUND HERE TO HAVE A GOOD CRY SAID THE LIKABLE SEEMING THIRTY FIVE YEAR OLD IN THE PRESS TENT AFTERWARD
 CHOKING BACK SOBS HE REMARKED IT'S ONLY A GAME RIGHT
 WHEN ASKED HE SAID THAT EVEN THE OUTLET OF GOING HOME AND KICKING HIS DOG WASN'T AVAILABLE
 MY DOG'S JUST EIGHT WEEKS OLD HE EXPLAINED
 INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SMALL MEDICAL BILLS IS ESPECIALLY WASTEFUL
 USUALLY IT WILL COST AN INSURER MORE THAN FIFTY DOLLARS TO MONITOR EFFECTIVELY A FIFTY DOLLAR PHYSICIAN BILL THEREBY DOUBLING THE COST OF HEALTH INSURANCE
 BUT FAILURE TO MONITOR ENCOURAGES PATIENTS AND DOCTORS TO MAKE WASTEFUL DECISIONS WITHOUT FEAR OF THIRD PARTY SCRUTINY

 BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT

 CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES
 HOWEVER MANY OF THESE INDUSTRIES HAVE SURVIVED AND ARE NOW AS TOUGH AND LEAN AS THEY'VE EVER BEEN
 THE MANAGERS OF THESE COMPANIES HAVE LEARNED THROUGH HARD EXPERIENCE ABOUT EXACTLY WHICH INVESTMENTS PAY OFF
 ALSO BIOTECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CASH GUZZLERS CONSTANTLY NEEDING MONEY FOR CLINICAL TRIALS AND MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

 SOME HUMAN RIGHTS GROUPS STRONGLY OPPOSED THE REQUEST CITING GUATEMALAN AUTHORITIES' HISTORY OF ABUSES
 MR. REICHLER LAUNCHED A LOBBYING BLITZ AMONG U. S. LIBERALS ARGUING THAT THE AID WOULD HELP STEM VIOLATIONS

 ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED BY CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL DISASTERS HAVE A SOUND PHYSICAL BASIS AND NEED TO BE DISCUSSED SERIOUSLY
 IN ADDITION TO DEFORESTATION EXAMPLES ARE
 IN ADDITION U. S. AIR HAS DEMANDED THAT P. S. A.'S UNIONS AGREE TO CHANGE CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF EXISTING CONTRACTS THAT RELATE TO MERGERS OR ACQUISITIONS
 A P. S. GROUP SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE PROVISIONS ARE
 HE SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY CONCERN THE RIGHTS OF THE UNION ORGANIZATIONS AND DON'T AFFECT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS
 MOREOVER GREYHOUND HAS TAKEN SOME TROUBLING STUMBLES IN THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONS
 LAST YEAR FOR INSTANCE PROFIT PLUMMETED AT THE PUREX UNIT A RESULT OF MAJOR MARKETING MISCALCULATIONS
 TWO MAJOR ALLEGED FRAUDS HAVE CROPPED UP IN THE COMPANY'S LEASING OPERATIONS
 EVEN FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS WHICH MR. TEETS KNOWS WELL HAVE BEEN HURT BADLY BY THE UNEVEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY
 IT'S BEEN OBVIOUS FOR YEARS THAT AMERICANS SAVE FAR TOO LITTLE
 EVER SINCE THE NEW DEAL WE'VE BECOME MORE AND MORE A NATION OF CONSUMERS
 BUT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH WHAT WE SPEND NOW IS BORROWED FROM THE NEXT GENERATION
 MR. THEOBALD SAID HE DIDN'T ACCEPT THE POSITION WHICH IS EFFECTIVE AUGUST THE FIRST MERELY TO BE A BIG BANK CHIEF EXECUTIVE
 I'M NOT LOOKING FOR POWER
 I HAVE ALL THE AUTHORITY I NEED AT CITICORP HE SAID NOTICING THAT THE INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATION HE HEADED THERE IS ITSELF BIGGER THAN CONTINENTAL
 DEATH IS THE KEY WORD SAID ONE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIAR WITH I. C. N.
 THERE ARE SOME KEY SHARES IN SOME VERY AGED HANDS AND THE FATE OF THIS COMPANY HINGES ON THESE SHARES
 I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD BUY THEM TODAY BUT THINGS CHANGE WHEN PEOPLE DIE
 A OFFICIAL SAID THE DESTRUCTION WEDNESDAY OF A ROCKET FUEL PLANT IN SOUTHERN NEVADA THREATENED U. S. PLANS TO REBUILD ITS SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM
 AND THE AIR FORCE SAID THE EXPLOSIONS MAY LIMIT FUTURE PRODUCTION OF MODERN MISSILES
 !NOISE AT LEAST ONE PERSON WAS KILLED AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE BLASTS
 THE MIDLAND TEXAS BASED PARTNERSHIP'S LATEST PROPOSAL GIVES TWO OPTIONS BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE A NEGOTIATED MERGER AGREEMENT
 ONE OPTION OFFERS MORE CASH PER SHARE BUT FOR FEWER SHARES
 THE OTHER SEEKS THE ENTIRE NINETY PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. G. THAT DESERT PARTNERS DOESN'T ALREADY OWN BUT HEAVILY INCREASES THE DEBT PORTION OF THE BID
 HOWEVER MOST FORECASTERS DON'T FORESEE A PERMANENT BREAK IN THE DROUGHT ANYTIME SOON
 THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OUT OF THE MIDWEST AMONG OTHER THINGS
 EVEN A RETURN TO A NORMAL SUMMER WEATHER PATTERN WOULD DO LITTLE TO PREVENT MORE DAMAGE TO CROPS
 THE SOIL IN MANY FARM STATES DIDN'T GET THE SPRINGTIME MOISTURE THAT CROPS NEED TO SURVIVE THE NORMALLY HOT AND DRY JULY AND AUGUST WEATHER
 IN MORE WAYS THAN NOT HOWEVER MR. JOBS IS HIS OLD SELF AN INTENSE OUTSPOKEN PERFECTIONIST DRIVING HIS EMPLOYEES AS HARD AS THEY WILL LET HIM
 IN NEXT'S THREE YEARS SOME TWENTY EMPLOYEES OUT OF ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY HAVE QUIT
 THE PACE WAS TOO GRUELING FOR SOME SAYS DENNIS BROTHERS WHO LEFT NEXT DURING THE SUMMER
 DESPITE LEAVING HE TERMS WORKING THERE ONE OF THE MORE INTERESTING EXPERIENCES OF MY LIFE
 DU PONT WHICH HAS MANAGED THE SAVANNAH RIVER FACILITY SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY WHEN IT SPRANG FROM THE MANHATTAN PROJECT DEFENDED THE PLANT YESTERDAY

 ACCORDING TO MINUTES OF THE MEETING MEMBERS OF THE PANEL DECIDED TO MAKE NO CHANGES IN THEIR CREDIT STANCE
 BUT THEY INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO TIGHTEN POLICY IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUED TO SHOW STRENGTH IF THE DOLLAR DROPPED SUBSTANTIALLY OR IF INFLATIONARY PRESSURES PICKED UP
 UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A TIGHTER FED POLICY WOULD PRESUMABLY LEAD TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES
 THE LATEST REPORT MAY LEAD TO SPECULATION THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED TIGHTENING POLICY AT ITS MOST RECENT MEETING LAST WEEK
 SINCE THE FEBRUARY MEETING THE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW SIGNS OF MODEST GROWTH THE DOLLAR HAS FALLEN FURTHER AND CONSUMER PRICES HAVE PICKED UP SLIGHTLY
 THE FED WON'T DISCLOSE WHETHER A DECISION WAS REACHED AT LAST WEEK'S MEETING UNTIL AFTER ITS CUSTOMARY DELAY OF SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS
 U. S. WEST INCORPORATED BOOSTED ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT TO EIGHTY TWO CENTS A SHARE PAYABLE MAY FIRST TO STOCK OF RECORD APRIL SIXTEENTH
 THE DENVER BASED REGIONAL BELL TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY PREVIOUSLY PAID SEVENTY SIX CENTS A SHARE !NOISE
 THE INCREASE REFLECTS CONFIDENCE IN THE DIRECTION AND STRENGTH OF OUR COMPANY SAID HOWARD DOERR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
 LAST MONTH OVERALL GOODS PRODUCING EMPLOYMENT FELL SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AFTER A THIRTY TWO THOUSAND JOB RISE IN FEBRUARY
 THE DEPARTMENT SAID THE DECLINE IN FACTORY JOBS WAS CONCENTRATED IN MOTOR VEHICLES AND ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT
 CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYMENT FELL FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND AFTER A FIFTEEN THOUSAND JOB DECLINE THE MONTH BEFORE
 MINING EMPLOYMENT WHICH INCLUDES THE OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION INDUSTRY ROSE THREE THOUSAND AFTER A ONE THOUSAND JOB RISE
 THE ASSOCIATION SAID THAT EMPLOYMENT INCREASED IN MARCH AFTER THE LENGTHY DECLINE
 IT SAID THAT SIXTEEN PERCENT OF THE PURCHASING MANAGERS REPORTED HIGHER EMPLOYMENT THE GREATEST PERCENTAGE SINCE MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
 IT SAID THAT FOURTEEN PERCENT REPORTED LOWER EMPLOYMENT THE LOWEST SINCE SEPTEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR
 THAT'S IN LARGE PART THE RESULT OF INVESTORS' INTEREST IN JAPANESE EQUITIES
 JAPANESE BANKS AND CORPORATIONS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT INTEREST BY OFFERING EURODOLLAR BONDS THAT OFFER AN EQUITY PLAY
 AS MUCH AS TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF SUCH ISSUES MAY COME TO MARKET THIS MONTH
 NISSAN WAS ONE OF ONLY TWO JAPANESE COMPANIES TO REPORT HIGHER SALES FOR MARCH
 THE OTHER WAS MITSUBISHI MOTORS CORPORATION'S U. S. SALES OPERATION
 BOTH COMPANIES OFFERED DEALERS CASH INCENTIVES DURING THE MONTH NISSAN ON THREE OF ITS BEST SELLING CARS AND MITSUBISHI ON ALL BUT ONE OF ITS PASSENGER CARS
 REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE TWO IMPORTERS SAID THE PROGRAMS HAVE ENDED AND NEW INCENTIVES HAVEN'T BEEN ANNOUNCED
 THE CHIEF TRADER IN NEW YORK FOR A TOKYO BASED BANK AGREES
 EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HE SAYS
 THE TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD
 WHAT BEGAN AS A LACKLUSTER SESSION FRIDAY GATHERED STEAM AS THE DOLLAR GAINED SOME GROUND AGAINST OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES
 SOME OF THE DEMAND CAME FROM BUY PROGRAMS TIED TO STOCK INDEX FUTURES
 BUT A GREATER PORTION CAME FROM INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
 IF THE PRESIDENT IS UNABLE TO PERSUADE A MAJORITY OF CONGRESS THERE MAY BE SOUND REASON FOR SETTING HIS REQUEST ASIDE REASONS MR. LEVINE
 YET A SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE AIDE CONCEDES THAT THE BILL ISN'T LIKELY TO PASS THIS YEAR
 IT ISN'T CLEAR THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT TO DO IT HE SAYS
 THE PLAN IS SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY SHAREHOLDERS AND GAMBLING REGULATORS IN NEVADA AND NEW JERSEY
 CAESARS SAID IT WILL SCHEDULE A SPECIAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING IN JUNE TO VOTE ON THE RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
 RECORD AND PAYMENT DATES FOR THE DIVIDEND WOULD BE SET LATER
 MR. SOSNOFF SAID HE IS BEGINNING TALKS WITH NEW JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS TO CREATE A NEW FINANCIAL PACKAGE
 IN ANY CASE HIS TWENTY EIGHT DOLLAR A SHARE OFFER FOR CAESARS ISN'T THE LAST WORD
 LAST WEEK THE INVESTOR SAID PRATT HOTEL CORPORATION AND SOUTHMARK CORPORATION DROPPED THEIR OFFER TO JOIN HIS TWENTY EIGHT DOLLAR BID TO ACQUIRE CAESARS
 U. A. L. SOARED SIX AND THREE QUARTERS TO SIXTY FIVE AND THREE QUARTERS IN HEAVY TRADING OF MORE THAN THREE POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES

 THE F. D. I. C. ARRANGED THE DEPOSIT TRANSFER BECAUSE OF DIFFICULTIES IN SORTING OUT THE FAILED BANK'S CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
 AT A NEWS CONFERENCE MR. KATZENBACH SAID THAT SUCH A MOVE MIGHT SWITCH SOME TRADING AWAY FROM CHICAGO WHERE MOST STOCK INDEX FUTURES AND OPTIONS ARE TRADED
 BUT HE SAID THAT WASN'T THE GOAL OF THE PROPOSAL
 A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS WANT TO INVEST IN BROAD FUNDS CHEAPLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY HE SAID
 THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN DO THAT NOW IS IN THE FUTURES MARKET
 AMERICAN EXPRESS ANNOUNCED THE BUY BACK AFTER THE STOCK MARKET CLOSED
 BUT IN COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE THE STOCK CLOSED AT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS UP ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS
 THE STOCK HAS TRADED AS HIGH AS FORTY POINT SIX TWO FIVE DOLLARS AND AS LOW AS TWENTY SIX POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS OVER THE PAST FIFTY TWO WEEKS

 THE MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE'S PLAN FOR THE NEW GOVERNING BODY CAN TAKE EFFECT IF APPROVED BY SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE EXCHANGE MEMBERS
 A MEMBERSHIP MEETING HAS BEEN CALLED FOR JULY TWENTIETH TO VOTE ON IT

 HOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE FARM ECONOMY WILL BEAR ON THIS ISSUE WHICH IS LIKELY TO COME TO A HEAD IN CONGRESS THIS FALL IS A GOOD QUESTION

 IT HAS SINCE REBOUNDED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE SEVEN WHERE IT CLOSED FRIDAY LOSING FOUR POINT FIVE SEVEN POINTS IN THE SESSION
 FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR FAMILY BUSINESS OWNERS IS THE UNCERTAINTY OVER WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING TO SEE IF THE PROPOSAL BECOMES LAW
 AND IF IT DOES IT IS UNCLEAR JUST WHEN THE NEW PROVISIONS WOULD TAKE EFFECT
 THE LEGISLATION ITSELF INDICATES THE DATE WOULD BE DECEMBER THE THIRTY FIRST BUT A CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE REPORT SAYS OCTOBER THIRTEENTH
 PRODUCER PRICES FELL ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN OCTOBER SUGGESTING FEARS OF RENEWED INFLATION ARE LARGELY UNFOUNDED
 THE UNEXPECTED DROP IN FINISHED GOODS PRICES WAS THE FIRST SINCE JULY NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
 MEANWHILE RETAIL SALES FELL ONLY ZERO POINT ONE PERCENT LAST MONTH INDICATING THE STOCK MARKET CRASH HAD LITTLE IMMEDIATE IMPACT ON CONSUMERS
 U. S. CAR SALES FELL TEN POINT ONE PERCENT IN EARLY NOVEMBER FROM A YEAR AGO
 THOUGH THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE THE STOCK MARKET PLUNGE HAD AFFECTED SALES THE OUTLOOK REMAINS UNCERTAIN
 CHRYSLER REDUCED SOME PRICES ON FRIDAY
 STOCK AND BOND PRICES FELL FRIDAY AMID CONCERN ABOUT LACK OF PROGRESS IN THE BUDGET TALKS
 THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIALS DROPPED TWENTY FIVE POINT TWO OH TO ONE THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE POINT OH ONE
 THE DOLLAR WAS LITTLE CHANGED
 I. C. H. HAS COMPLETED SEVERAL ACQUISITIONS IN RECENT YEARS THE LARGEST BEING ITS ONE POINT THREE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR PURCHASE OF TENNECO INCORPORATED'S INSURANCE LINES LAST YEAR
 SOUTHMARK HAS ALSO A STRING OF SMALL ACQUISITIONS
 EARLIER THIS YEAR IT CONSIDERED A JOINT BID FOR CONTROL OF CAESARS WORLD INCORPORATED THE LOS ANGELES BASED OWNER OF CASINO HOTELS
 SOUTHMARK SAID IT INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF ITS OWN GAMBLING INTERESTS PRIOR TO THE CLOSING OF THE I. C. H. TRANSACTION
 THE BOSTON PROPERTY WAS FULLY OCCUPIED A BROKER CLOSE TO THE BUILDING SAID
 IT WAS A DONE DEAL
 ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY CAME BACK AND SAID WE AREN'T BUYING AT THIS YIELD
 I SAID GIVE ME A PRICE AND THEY SAID NO
 IF A PERSON DOES HOPE TO KEEP WORKING WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF FINDING A SIMILAR JOB AT THE SAME PAY
 BETWEEN SLIM AND NONE
 MOST PEOPLE WILL FIND THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT AND NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE JOB MARKET OFFERS FEWER OPPORTUNITIES THAN THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES SAYS MR. WATERS
 ANOTHER COMMON MISTAKE MANY PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE HOW LONG THEY HAVE LEFT TO LIVE
 PEOPLE SHOULD PLAN ON LIVING THIRTY YEARS IN RETIREMENT MS. MERCER SAYS
 YOUR ASSETS HAVE TO LAST THAT LONG
 DID THE FRIENDS LOSE ALL THEIR MONEY IN THE DEAL TOO
 AT LEAST I HOPE THEY DID
 IT'S IRONIC BUT FIFTY YEARS AGO U. S. CONSUMERS FELT EXACTLY THE SAME WAY ABOUT JAPANESE GOODS
 THEY WERE CHEAP BUT THEY WERE SHODDY
 ANYTHING EVEN REMOTELY MARKETABLE HERE WAS OF COURSE ONLY A CLUMSY IMITATION OF AMERICAN GOOD
 AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THE FIRST GOODS JAPAN TRIED TO MARKET IN THE U. S. WERE NOT GEARED TO THE U. S. MARKET AT ALL
 THE CARS WERE RUGGED BECAUSE THEY HAD TO BE TO SURVIVE ON POOR JAPANESE ROADS
 BUT THE STYLING LOOKED A BIT LIKE INVERTED BATHTUBS
 IN
 WILLIAMS LIMAN AND FLUMENBAUM MR. MILKEN HAS RETAINED AN EXPERIENCED TEAM
 MR. WILLIAMS DEFENDED FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR AND TREASURY SECRETARY JOHN CONNALLY AND FORMER CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HEAD RICHARD HELMS
 HE ALSO HAS LONG REPRESENTED THE WASHINGTON POST AND IS A FORMER PART OWNER OF THE WASHINGTON REDSKINS
 CONCERNING THE ACQUISITION OF THE HUTTON INSURANCE GROUP MR. WEINGARTEN SAID THE PURCHASE WILL BE FINANCED PRINCIPALLY THROUGH A SYNDICATED BANK LOAN
 THE BALANCE WILL BE FINANCED THROUGH THE ISSUE OF JUNIOR SECRETARIES
 HE DECLINED TO ELABORATE
 POPE AND TALBOT SAID ITS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER PETER T. POPE MADE THE EARNINGS PROJECTION IN A PRESENTATION TO NEW YORK SECURITIES ANALYSTS
 ESTIMATED REVENUE WASN'T DISCLOSED
 THE COMPANY SAID FIRST QUARTER RESULTS WILL BE RELEASED APRIL FIFTEENTH
 DESPITE MONTHS OF PREPARATION IT WAS CLEAR THAT THE U. S. WAS TAKEN BY SURPRISE BY THE MINE EXPLOSION FRIDAY
 MOREOVER NAVY OFFICIALS SAID THE INCIDENT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE SERIOUS IF THE MINE HAD HIT ONE OF THE THREE U. S. WARSHIPS ESCORTING THE BRIDGETON
 THE NAVY SHIPS ALL ARE CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN THE FOUR HUNDRED ONE THOUSAND TON TANKER AND THEY KEEP IMPORTANT NAVAL EQUIPMENT CLOSE TO THEIR HULLS
 THE DOLLAR'S CLIMB TO MORE THAN ONE POINT SEVEN ONE MARKS OVER THE WEEKEND HAD SPURRED BUYING OF WEST GERMAN SHARES
 A HIGHER DOLLAR BOOSTS GROWTH PROSPECTS FOR THE COUNTRY'S EXPORT LINKED ECONOMY
 THE RISE CAME AMID OPTIMISM ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF AN AGREEMENT TO REDUCE THE U. S. BUDGET DEFICIT
 THE COMPANY RECENTLY NEGOTIATED A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR FINANCING PACKAGE TO CONTINUE ITS EXPANSION PROGRAM
 MR. ADLER SAID HE SEEKS TO ACQUIRE FIFTY FIVE STORES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT START UP TWENTY NEW FRANCHISES AND CONVERT TEN INDEPENDENT STORES INTO FRANCHISES
 BY NINETEEN NINETY ONE THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO HAVE SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY FRANCHISES AND COMPANY OWNED STORES COMPARED WITH TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO NOW
 THEN THE PROSECUTORS AFTER LOCATING NEW WITNESSES SUDDENLY CHANGED COURSE
 EARLY THIS YEAR WILLIAM WELD AT THE TIME HEAD OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT'S CRIMINAL DIVISION TOLD OFFICIALS FROM OTHER DEPARTMENTS INDICTMENTS WOULD BE HANDED UP SOON
 BUT HE REFUSED TO GIVE MUCH INFORMATION
 IN AN INTERVIEW THIS WEEK MR. WELD RECALLED THAT HE CITED GRAND JURY SECRECY CONSTRAINTS AND READ ONLY FROM A PREPARED SUMMARY OF THE CHARGES
 THE MOVE COULD MEAN THAT THE HAFTS WHO GOT THEIR START IN RETAILING IN THE DRUGSTORE BUSINESS ARE CONSIDERING A BID FOR WALGREEN
 THE HAFTS WHO CONTROL DART GROUP CORPORATION HAVE SAID THEY WANT TO BUY ANOTHER MAJOR RETAILER
 THEY CURRENTLY ARE INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING KROGER COMPANY
 THE SUPERMARKET CHAIN RECENTLY SPURNED THE HAFTS BUT THE FAMILY SAID IT REMAINS INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH THE CINCINNATI BASED COMPANY ON ITS RESTRUCTURING PLAN
 NO ONE IS PROJECTING A PRECIPITOUS PRICE PLUMMET LIKE THE ONE THAT DRAGGED THE INDUSTRY INTO A RECESSION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
 LOWER SALES MAY REFLECT SEASONAL FACTORS WHICH MAY BE COMPOUNDED BY CHANGING BUYING HABITS AMONG PURCHASERS
 SOME PURCHASERS EXPECT DEMAND TO PICK UP SOON
 AND SOME CHIP MAKERS CONTINUE TO DO WELL BY FOCUSING ON SPECIALITY MARKETS
 SOME STEEL EXECUTIVES THOUGH THINK THE INDUSTRY MAY BE OVERREACTING
 FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THE DEMAND HAS FALLEN OFF AS DRAMATICALLY AS SOME SERVICE CENTERS FEAR SAYS AN EXECUTIVE AT A MIDWESTERN SERVICE CENTER
 IN FACT MAJOR STEELMAKERS REPORT FIRM ORDERS FOR MANY PRODUCT LINES AS OF THE MIDDLE OF LAST MONTH AND THE CAPITAL GOODS SECTOR REMAINS RELATIVELY ROBUST
 IN THIS FLOODED MARKET LEXUS HAS AN IMPORTANT STRENGTH A BIG PRICE EDGE ON ITS GERMAN COMPETITORS
 BUT WITH THE LUXURY MARKET SOFT AND CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ABOUT MAKING CAR PURCHASES WANING THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO ESTABLISH A STRONG PRESENCE
 THE LINE ALSO FACES THE CHALLENGE OF FORGING AN IDENTITY ONE DISTINCT NOT ONLY FROM LEXUS'S RIVALS BUT ALSO FROM TOYOTA ITSELF

 SECOND QUARTER PRETAX PROFITS FELL FROM FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST QUARTER
 REVENUE DROPPED FOURTEEN PERCENT TO TWELVE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM FOURTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS
 IN LAST YEAR'S SECOND QUARTER PRETAX EARNINGS WERE ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
 THE PROBLEM HERE TOO IS THAT THE GUARANTEE IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE ENTITY PROVIDING IT !NOISE
 SO FAR NEITHER S. AND P. NOR A. M. BEST DISTINGUISHES ANY QUALITY DIFFERENCE AMONG THE DOZENS OF INSURERS INVOLVED IN THE G. I. C. BUSINESS
 RECENTLY HOWEVER MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE INCORPORATED INTRODUCED A LISTING OF SOME G. I. C. ISSUERS THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME RATES SOME BELOW TRIPLE A QUALITY
 THE COMPANY ALSO HAS SETTLED SEVERAL HUNDRED PRODUCT LIABILITY CASES OUT OF COURT INVOLVING THE COPPER SEVEN THE SPOKESWOMAN
 ABOUT THE SAME NUMBER OF COPPER SEVEN CASES HAVE BEEN DISMISSED BY COURTS SHE SAID
 SEARLE HAS ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED COPPER SEVEN CASES CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST IT SHE ADDED
 THAT THE TRADE DEFICIT ISN'T THE DOLLAR'S ONLY PROBLEM IS ALSO RESTRAINING MARKET OPTIMISM FOR A MAJOR RECOVERY
 CONTINUED FEAR OF A RECESSION WILL KEEP DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON U. S. INTEREST RATES TRADERS SAID
 LOWER INTEREST RATES DECREASE THE APPEAL OF DOLLAR INVESTMENTS AND IN TURN DEMAND FOR DOLLARS
 THIS IS WELL UNDERSTOOD BY MOST O. T. C. PORTFOLIO MANAGERS MANY OF WHOM WERE IN ON THE INITIAL OFFERINGS
 IN FACT THESE ARE THE STOCKS MOST OF THESE FUNDS ARE BUYING AT THE MOMENT
 THEY ARE HUNTING IN THE DEPRESSED O. T. C. MARKET AMONG LISTS OF THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OR SO ISSUES THAT WENT PUBLIC IN THE THREE MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH
 IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING FRIDAY T. E. C. SHARES CLOSED AT FOUR POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS DOWN TWELVE POINT FIVE CENTS
 FOR ITS FIRST QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH T. E. C. EARNED TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS OR THREE CENTS A SHARE ON SALES OF ABOUT TWO MILLION DOLLARS
 NET INCOME INCLUDED A GAIN OF ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FROM THE SALE OF A PRODUCT LINE
 PAUL NISBET OF PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES REDUCED HIS FOURTH QUARTER ESTIMATE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT TO NINETY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
 DAVID SMITH OF ALEX
 BROWN AND SONS CUT HIS ESTIMATE TO NINETY FIVE CENTS A SHARE FROM ONE DOLLAR FIFTEEN CENTS
 TRADERS SAY THE RULE ALREADY HAS HAD SOME IMPACT ON THE MARKET
 MR. BAKER SAYS THAT ON FRIDAY MORNING THE MOVES IN FUTURES INDICATED THAT THE INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE WOULD HAVE GAINED SEVENTY TO NINETY POINTS
 SO THEY RESTRAINED THEMSELVES
 SOME GUYS DID BACK AWAY HE CONTENDS AND THE INDUSTRIALS ROSE ONLY ABOUT FIFTY POINTS IN THE FIRST HALF HOUR OF STOCK TRADING
 MR. BAKER SAYS THAT THE PROGRAM TRADING LIMIT IS A GOOD IDEA TEMPORARILY BUT THAT IT WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE FOR THE LONGER TERM
 I DON'T SEE HOW THEY CAN BASICALLY PASS LEGISLATION TO STOP PROGRAM TRADING HE ARGUES
 YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THEY WON'T COME UP A NEW PRODUCT
 THERE'S A LOT OF SMART PEOPLE OUT THERE
 PRODUCER PRICES FELL ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT IN DECEMBER INDICATING INFLATION REMAINS UNDER
 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PRICES ROSE TWO POINT TWO PERCENT
 INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT GAINED ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT LAST MONTH AND THREE POINT EIGHT PERCENT FOR THE YEAR
 WELLS FARGO SAID THE PURCHASE WILL STRENGTHEN ITS RETAIL PRESENCE IN CALIFORNIA AND REFLECTS ITS STRATEGY OF CONCENTRATING ON THE MARKET IN ITS HOME STATE
 WELLS FARGO WHICH HAD ASSETS OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS AS OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH OPERATES FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY SEVEN BRANCHES IN CALIFORNIA
 FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN FIRST NINE MONTHS WELLS FARGO POSTED A LOSS OF SIXTY POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS
 HOW DOES HE FIND THESE THINGS OUT
 HIS INFORMATION AMAZES ME MR. EDELMAN SAYS THROUGH A SPOKESMAN
 I DON'T KNOW HOW HE GETS IT
 STILL G. E. HAS USED THE TECHNIQUES OF THE CORPORATE RAIDER IN DIGESTING R. C. A.
 IT HAS SOLD ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS OF R. C. A.'S ASSETS INCLUDING RECORDS LIFE INSURANCE CARPETING AND LOAN RECEIVABLES
 G. E. PLANS TO CUT THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS NEXT YEAR
 AND THE COMPANY SAYS IT COULD MAKE ANOTHER R. C. A. SIZE ACQUISITION NEXT YEAR IF IT WERE WILLING TO SEE ITS CREDIT RATING DOWNGRADED TO DOUBLE A.
 FIRST INTERSTATE BUCKED THE TREND AND ROSE ONE TO FIFTY SEVEN
 THE WEST COAST BANK DROPPED ITS TAKEOVER OFFER FOR BANKAMERICA SAYING BANKAMERICA'S CONTINUED ASSET SALES MADE FIRST INTERSTATE'S THREE POINT TWO THREE BILLION DOLLAR TAKEOVER PROPOSAL TOO HIGH

 MR. POZOS NOTES THAT SCANDINAVIANS HAVE BEEN RUNNING OUT OF SAUNAS AND PLUNGING INTO ICY WATER FOR YEARS
 IF IT HADN'T BEEN GOOD FOR THEM HE SAYS THEY'D ALL BE DEAD
 ALL EYES ARE NOW UPON TEXAS
 TEXACO ALREADY HAS APPEALED THE MERITS OF THE CASE TO THE STATE SUPREME COURT
 THE JUSTICES CAN SAVE THEMSELVES THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REVIEW BY FEDERAL COURTS IF THEY DO NOW WHAT JUDGE CASSEB SHOULD HAVE DONE TWO YEARS AGO
 THEY COULD TAKE JUDICIAL NOTICE OF THE FACT THAT ANOTHER STATE'S LAW APPLIES AND CERTIFY THE CASE AS ONE FOR THE NEW YORK COURTS
 THEY BETTER HURRY UP PENNZOIL'S MR. JAMAIL SAID YESTERDAY
 PENNZOIL'S ASSURANCE THAT IT WON'T BEGIN SECURING THE JUDGMENT IS GOOD ONLY IF TEXACO PROMPTLY BEGINS SEEKING RESOLUTION OF THE BOND AND LIEN CONTROVERSY IN THE TEXAS COURTS
 ASKED TO DEFINE PROMPTLY MR. JAMAIL SAID THEY'VE GOT TILL TOMORROW MEANING TODAY
 ALL THIS HAS LEFT GRAIN EXPORTERS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON ONE MAJOR IMPORTER THE SOVIET UNION
 TWO YEARS AGO ONE QUARTER OF THE WORLD'S GRAIN EXPORTS WERE BOUND FOR RUSSIAN PORTS
 BUT SOVIET PURCHASES HAVE PLUMMETED SINCE THEN AND LAST FALL THE U. S. S. R. HARVESTED ITS BEST CROP SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT
 REALITY HERE IS DIFFERENT FROM IDEALS A FOREIGN FUND MANAGER WHO HAS WORKED IN TOKYO FOR SEVERAL YEARS SAYS
 YOUR STANDARDS DON'T CHANGE BUT YOU'VE GOT TO BE PRACTICAL AND SENSIBLE
 YOU'VE GOT TO PICK UP THE INVESTMENT TOOLS OF THE MARKET
 HEAVY INDUSTRY SHARES DREW INVESTORS BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIVELY LOW PRICE AND LAGGARD STATUS DEALERS SAID
 ISHIKAWAJIMA HARIMA FOR INSTANCE MOVED UP THIRTEEN YEN TO SEVEN THIRTY SEVEN YEN FIVE DOLLARS AND TWELVE CENTS
 KAWASAKI STEEL GAINED ELEVEN YEN TO TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO YEN AND NIPPON STEEL WAS UP SIX YEN AT THREE HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN YEN
 WHATEVER DEVELOPS SLOW GROWTH SEEMS PREFERABLE TO NO GROWTH OR ECONOMIC DECLINE
 BUT IT ALSO MAY BE PREFERABLE TO SWIFT GROWTH WHICH COULD BRING ON THE SORTS OF PRESSURES THAT IN THE PAST HAVE HASTENED RECESSIONS
 AND IRONICALLY THOSE PRESSURES SEEM MUCH LIKELIER TO BUILD DANGEROUSLY IF THE U. S. GETS ITS WAY AT VENICE
 IN SHORT WHO WOULD REALLY RUN FOREIGN OR DEFENSE POLICY MR. DUKAKIS OR MR. NUNN
 STILL IN THE HEAT OF A POLITICAL CONVENTION STRANGE IDEAS DO SURFACE LIKE SPIRO AGNEW THOMAS EAGLETON AND GERALDINE FERRARO
 AND UNTIL COOLER HEADS PREVAILED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY RONALD REAGAN WAS TEMPTED TO OFFER GERALD FORD A POSITION MUCH LIKE THAT ENVISIONED FOR SENATOR NUNN
 STATE AND LOCAL PROPERTY TAXES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NATIONWIDE TOTAL PERSONAL INCOME ROSE STEADILY FROM THE NINETEEN FIFTIES THROUGH NINETEEN SEVENTY THREE
 FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR THROUGH NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES GENERALLY DECLINED AS A PERCENTAGE OF INCOME
 THERE HAS BEEN A MODEST INCREASE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE
 THE NATIONAL TREND OF RELATIVELY DECLINING STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WAS ABOUT FIVE YEARS OLD WHEN CALIFORNIA GOT ON THE BANDWAGON
 WHY THE BIG DISCOUNT FOR THE CAPITAL SHARES
 AFTER ALL THOSE SHARES' NET ASSET VALUE HAS ACTUALLY APPRECIATED EIGHTEEN PERCENT IN LINE WITH THE LIPPER INDEX
 MR. HERZFELD SAYS THE SHARES' DISCOUNT RESEMBLES THAT OF A ZERO COUPON BOND BECAUSE INVESTORS WON'T SEE THE PAYOUT UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN

 THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY DAYS IN ADVANCE A TICKET HAS TO BE PURCHASED IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY
 THE MORE RESTRICTIVE THE ADVANCE PURCHASE REQUIREMENT THE LESS DAMAGING A CHEAP FARE IS FOR THE AIRLINE
 THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FARE PARTICULARLY BUSINESS TRAVELERS IS LIMITED
 ONE REASON THE MAXSAVER HAS ATTRACTED SO MUCH ATTENTION IS THAT ITS TWO DAY ADVANCE PURCHASE REQUIREMENT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR VIRTUALLY ANYBODY TO USE THE FARE
 BUT IT PROBABLY WOULD BE A MOOT ISSUE HE SAID BECAUSE THE I. C. O. CAN'T PULL THE PRICE UP TO ANY LEVEL

 THIS WEEK THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE APPROVED A BAN ON VIRTUALLY ALL U. S. INVESTMENT AND TRADE WITH SOUTH AFRICA
 IT IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SANCTIONS ALREADY IN PLACE HAVE CAUSED THOUSANDS OF BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS TO LOSE THEIR JOBS

 F. C. A. CONFIRMED THAT IT HAS REACHED A TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION STEMMING FROM THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE

 THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER
 FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE
 SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL
 BUT THE FED IS ALSO UNDER INTENSE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO AVOID RAISING INTEREST RATES BEFORE THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
 ALL SIX FED GOVERNORS WERE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN AND FED CHAIRMAN ALAN GREENSPAN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
 FED OFFICIALS ALSO WORRY THAT SHARPLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD DAMAGE STILL WEAK SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY AND EXACERBATE PROBLEMS AMONG TROUBLED BANKS AND THRIFT INSTITUTIONS
 CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE
 HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER
 BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES
 THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
 A DROP IN OIL PRICES COULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME PRICE RELIEF AS IT DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
 THE RECENT FAILURE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO REACH AN AGREEMENT LIMITING PRODUCTION SUGGESTS PRICES MIGHT FALL SOME
 BUT ANY DIP IN INFLATION ASSOCIATED WITH OIL PRICES IS LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY
 L. T. V. WILL PRESENT THE PLAN TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF ITS BANK AND CREDITOR COMMITTEES NEXT WEEK

 I'M TELLING YOU THERE IS NO WORK FOR WHITES IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY
 WHAT WORK THERE IS IS DONE BY BLACKS HE SAYS
 WHEN I STARTED PAINTING WAS A SKILLED TRADE WITH A FIVE YEAR APPRENTICESHIP
 NOW THREE WEEKS AND YOU'RE A PAINTER
 NOW I KNOW THAT SOUNDS BAD BUT IT REALLY ISN'T SAYS A THRIFTY SPOKESWOMAN
 THE DEPOSIT SHE CONCEDES EFFECTIVELY BANS DRIVERS WHO DON'T HAVE CREDIT CARDS BUT TOO MANY CASH RENTERS STEAL RENTAL CARS
 THE CREDIT CARD GIVES US SOME IDEA OF WHO THE PERSON IS SHE SAYS
 WE NEED TO PROTECT OURSELVES
 THEY SEEM LIKE THE ULTIMATE CONVENIENCE FOOD
 AS EASY TO PREPARE AS FROZEN OR CANNED PRODUCTS BUT BOASTING THE FRESHNESS AND EYE APPEAL OF HOME COOKING
 IN THE FOOD BUSINESS THEY ARE KNOWN AS FRESH REFRIGERATED PRODUCTS AND THEY ARE THE BIGGEST THING TO HIT THE INDUSTRY SINCE THE MICROWAVE
 THAT SUITS MR. MACH JUST FINE
 I HATE TO MAKE THINGS TO SELL HE SAYS
 EVERYTHING DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A COMMODITY
 TO ME THESE WORKS ARE A PERFORMANCE
 IT'S LIKE A CIRCUS COMING TO TOWN
 THE OFFENDING EDITORIAL WAS PUBLISHED MAY SEVENTEENTH
 BOTH MR. GORDON AND MR. MCGILL STANDING FOR RE ELECTION WON DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY RACES JUNE FOURTEENTH
 A GRAND JURY HERE INDICTED MR. FITTS ON MONDAY AND A TRIAL DATE HAS YET TO BE SET
 NO SOONER DID THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION IMPOSE NEW RULES TO CLARIFY FUND ADVERTISING THAN FUND YIELDS SIMPLY DISAPPEARED FROM MANY ADS
 THE S. E. C. IS MANEUVERING TO CURB WHAT FUNDS CAN SAY IN NEWSLETTERS JUST AS HOLDERS ARE DEMANDING MORE INFORMATION
 IN RESPONSE TO OTHER RULES ON THE HORIZON FUNDS ARE HINTING THAT THEY WILL SQUEEZE BIGGER UP FRONT FEES OUT OF PEOPLE BUYING INTO A FUND
 BANK EARNINGS GENERALLY WERE SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING
 RISING INTEREST RATES DURING THE SECOND QUARTER PUT PRESSURE ON NET INTEREST MARGINS
 NONPERFORMING LOANS CONTINUED TO RISE AT MANY BANKS AS COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE MARKETS CONTINUED DOWNWARD
 MONEY CENTER BANKS ALSO CHARGED OFF TWENTY PERCENT OF THE LOAN EXPOSURE TO ARGENTINA
 MANUFACTURERS HANOVER'S COMPARISON WITH THE PRIOR YEAR'S EARNINGS WAS DISTORTED BY A GAIN LAST YEAR ON THE SALE OF A FINANCE SUBSIDIARY
 CHEMICAL BANKING AND BANKERS TRUST BOTH POSTED RECORD OR NEAR RECORD FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRADING RESULTS

 IT'S WHAT HE DOESN'T SAY THAT HAS RILED ONE FUND INVESTOR
 THE REPORT IT SEEMS FAILS TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT NEW YORK'S CREDIT CONDITIONS OR FACTORS TIED TO THAT MARKET
 IT DOES TALK ABOUT THE GENERAL MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET THOUGH
 MORTGAGES OF FOUR PERCENT
 YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY BACK TO NINETEEN FIFTY ONE TO FIND RATES THAT LOW
 BUT IF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT HAS ITS WAY LENDERS MAY BE OFFERING HOME LOANS AT SUCH LOW INITIAL RATES BY YEAR END
 THE OFFICIAL CHINA DAILY SAID SATURDAY THAT AS OF SEPTEMBER FIRST THE RESERVE RATIO FOR BANKS WILL BE INCREASED TO THIRTEEN PERCENT FROM TWELVE PERCENT
 THE DAILY SAID THAT AS A RESULT LOANS WILL BE REDUCED BY MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION YUAN EIGHT POINT OH SIX BILLION DOLLARS
 IT DIDN'T GIVE A TIME PERIOD FOR THIS REDUCTION
 THE RESERVE RATIO WAS SET AT TEN PERCENT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE AND INCREASED TO TWELVE PERCENT LAST YEAR
 RECENT ROBUST LENDING MAINLY FOR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS HAS PUT A STRAIN ON THE NATION'S ABILITY TO MEET DEMANDS FOR RAW MATERIALS AND HAS HELPED FUEL INFLATION
 PRICES IN JUNE WERE NINETEEN PERCENT HIGHER THAN A YEAR EARLIER ACCORDING TO THE GOVERNMENT
 MR. CAMPBELL BELIEVES THE JULY C. P. I. ROSE ABOUT ZERO POINT FIVE PERCENT AND THE CONSENSUS VIEW IS THAT A ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT INCREASE WILL BE REPORTED
 IN JUNE THE C. P. I. ROSE ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT
 HIGHER FOOD PRICES RESULTING FROM THE DROUGHT AND STEEPER ENERGY COSTS CONTRIBUTED TO A JUMP IN JULY ACCORDING TO THE ECONOMIST
 PERSONAL INCOME AND CONSUMPTION ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE BEEN HIGHER DURING JULY THANKS LARGELY TO THE STRONG EMPLOYMENT
 WITH MORE PEOPLE WORKING NOW THAN IN THE PAST FOURTEEN YEARS AND MANY WORKING MORE HOURS THAN NORMALLY PERSONAL INCOME IS EXPECTED TO LOG ANOTHER INCREASE
 IN JUNE PERSONAL INCOME ROSE ZERO POINT SEVEN PERCENT
 ON THE SPENDING SIDE CONSUMPTION PROBABLY INCREASED AGAIN IN JULY HELPED ALONG ONCE MORE BY CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES

 AUTOMATIC SPENDING CUTS WILL BE TRIGGERED ONLY IF THE WHITE HOUSE PROJECTION EXCEEDS ONE HUNDRED FORTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS
 ON FRIDAY MR. FLOOD SAID MY REACTION IS ONE OF SHOCK
 THIS RAISES ISSUES FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF ITALY
 YESTERDAY HOWEVER HE SAID IT ISN'T AS NEGATIVE AS I INITIALLY THOUGHT
 IT'S TRUE I'M SURPRISED BY IT
 DOFASCO HAMILTON ONTARIO SAID ABOUT THREE POINT THREE MILLION CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED SHARES ABOUT EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THE TOTAL OUTSTANDING WERE TENDERED
 ALL OF THE SHARES TENDERED HAVE AN INDICATED VALUE OF ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION CANADIAN DOLLARS FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY EIGHT MILLION U. S. DOLLARS
 THE OFFERS FOR BOTH CLASSES OF STOCK EXPIRED FRIDAY
 BUT OTHER COMPANIES SAY THAT SMOKERS AND NONSMOKERS ALIKE WILL ACCEPT RESTRICTIONS IF IMPLEMENTED CORRECTLY
 THAT MEANS IN PART PLENTY OF EMPLOYEE COMMUNICATION ADVANCE WARNING AND FREE STOP SMOKING CLASSES
 PROPONENTS OF SUCH RULES CLAIM THAT CORPORATIONS STAND TO GAIN IN THE WAY OF HEALTHIER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE WORKERS LESS ABSENTEEISM AND LOWER INSURANCE AND MAINTENANCE COSTS
 IN ANY CASE BOTH THE NEW V. C. R.S AND THE C. D. V. DISK REPRESENT EXTENSIONS OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGY NOT DRAMATIC BREAKTHROUGHS
 DIGITAL AUDIO TAPES AND PLAYERS ON THE OTHER HAND ARE ARGUABLY THE NEAREST THING AT THE SHOW TO A BREAKTHROUGH
 MANY OWNERS OF COPYRIGHTS ON MOVIES AND MUSIC ARE LOBBYING CONGRESS TO PREVENT THE MACHINES FROM BEING USED FOR HOME TAPING
 WITH THE HIGH PROFILE ISSUE STILL UNRESOLVED NO MAJOR JAPANESE COMPANY APPEARS WILLING TO SELL THE MACHINES IN THE U. S. YET
 THE NOVEMBER DROP BROUGHT THE INDEX TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY POINT TWO PERCENT OF ITS NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AVERAGE FROM ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN OCTOBER
 THE OCTOBER RISE WAS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT DROP
 IN YESTERDAY'S RELEASE THE DEPARTMENT ALSO REVISED THE SEPTEMBER PERFORMANCE TO A ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT RISE AFTER PREVIOUSLY REPORTING IT AS UNCHANGED
 A NINETEEN SEVENTY ONE FEDERAL LAW CREATED THE CORPORATIONS TO HOLD ASSETS CONFERRED ON ALASKAN NATIVES IN EXCHANGE FOR TERMINATING THEIR BROAD CLAIMS TO LANDS IN THE STATE
 THE THIRTEEN REGIONAL CORPORATIONS AND SCORES OF VILLAGE CORPORATIONS SELECTED ABOUT FORTY MILLION ACRES OF LAND AND RECEIVED ALMOST ONE BILLION DOLLARS
 A FEW HAVE PROSPERED BY EXPLOITING TIMBER OIL AND GAS OR OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES
 BUT MANY HAVE EXHAUSTED THEIR FINANCES IN LEGAL BATTLES AND UNWISE INVESTMENTS
 THAT WAS THE MOOD AT THE LAST MONTHLY MEETING
 NOW GATHERED AROUND FORMICA TABLES CLUTTERED WITH LEGAL PADS BEER BOTTLES AND PAPER PLACE MATS THE MEN ARE HUMBLED
 EVEN A MORON HAD THE MIDAS TOUCH A YEAR AGO MR. BINDER SAYS
 THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY
 MOST BROKERAGE HOUSES AND MANY INVESTMENT OR MUTUAL FUND COMPANIES CAN GIVE SOME FORM OF FINANCIAL PLANNING ADVICE
 AT THE TOP END SOME OFFER SERVICES COSTING TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OR MORE FOR HIGH NET WORTH CLIENTS
 BUT MOST HAVE AT LEAST SOME FREE OR VERY LOW COST PLAN THAT RELIES HEAVILY ON COMPUTER GENERATED
 THESE ARE GENERALLY AS GOOD AS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION A CLIENT GIVES THE PLANNER AND CAN COST A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS
 IT WAS A CRAZY DAY SAID PETER BEUTEL ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF THE ENERGY GROUP AT ELDERS FUTURES INCORPORATED
 IT'S IMPORTANT WE CLOSED OVER THE SEVENTEEN DOLLAR LEVEL
 TWO DAYS AGO IT LOOKED VERY VERY NEGATIVE
 THEY REALLY HAD THIS MARKET ON THE ROPES AND THEY COULDN'T FINISH IT OFF
 VETERANS OF NEW AGE PUBLISHING SCOFF AT THE EVER WIDENING DEFINITION OF THE CATEGORY
 BANTAM BOOKS INCORPORATED A UNIT OF BERTELSMANN A. G. OF WEST GERMANY STARTED ITS BANTAM NEW AGE BOOKS LINE EIGHT YEARS AGO
 TONI BURBANK EXECUTIVE EDITOR FOR THE IMPRINT SAYS BANTAM HAS EXERCISED SOME RESTRAINT IN ADDING TO THE LIST PARTLY OUT OF DEFERENCE TO EXISTING AUTHORS
 SOME OF THEM DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE RIGHT NEXT TO A TAROT CARD BOOK SHE SAYS
 ROMAN OWNS FIFTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT OF DENISON WHOSE MAIN INTERESTS ARE IN MINING OIL AND GAS
 DENISON HOLDS A THIRTY SIX POINT SEVEN PERCENT VOTING STAKE IN ROMAN WHICH HAS INTERESTS IN PACKAGING AND PRINTING
 BOTH ARE BASED IN TORONTO
 THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR OF ARKANSAS WILLIAM CLINTON CALLS MR. KEAN A VERY EFFECTIVE GIFTED MAN
 HE'S BEEN AHEAD OF THE CURVE
 AND HE'S GOT A GOOD HEART TOO
 IT'S NOT JUST A JOB TO HIM
 HIS FEELINGS ARE REAL AND DEEP
 WE'RE CERTAINLY PLEASED WITH THE ONTARIO COURT'S DECISION BUT THIS IS ONE HEAT ONLY

 THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS IN ADDITION TO A SIX MILLION SHARE PROGRAM ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR
 REPURCHASE OF THE ENTIRE EIGHT MILLION SHARES WOULD RESULT IN THIRTY FOUR MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
 AMERITRUST SAID IT WOULD FINANCE THE REPURCHASE THROUGH INTERNAL FUNDS SHORT TERM BORROWINGS AND SOME OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN CENTRAL BANCORP
 CANADIAN GOVERNMENT BONDS FELL ABOUT ONE EIGHTH POINT TO ONE QUARTER POINT
 THE GOVERNMENT'S NINE AND ONE HALF PERCENT BONDS DUE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT DECLINED TO NINETY FOUR AND FIVE EIGHTHS BID TO YIELD TEN POINT THREE SEVEN PERCENT
 THAT COMPARED WITH NINETY FOUR AND SEVEN EIGHTHS TO YIELD TEN POINT THREE THREE PERCENT LATE WEDNESDAY
 A HANDFUL OF NEW ISSUES CAME TO MARKET IN BOTH THE INVESTMENT GRADE AND JUNK BOND SECTORS
 FOR THE MOST PART THE DEALS WERE SAID TO BE SELLING WELL
 SECURITY PACIFIC CORPORATION SOLD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF FIVE YEAR SENIOR NOTES
 IN ANOTHER BANK OFFERING BANK OF BOSTON SOLD ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SUBORDINATED NOTES
 THE NIKKEI INDEX EASED FORTY NINE POINT FIVE OH POINTS TO CLOSE AT TWENTY EIGHT THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TWENTY NINE POINT THREE SIX
 THE TOKYO STOCK PRICE INDEX OF ALL FIRST SECTION ISSUES FELL TWO POINT SIX EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THREE POINT EIGHT SEVEN
 VOLUME ON THE FIRST SECTION WAS ESTIMATED AT SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHARES DOWN FROM EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION SHARES WEDNESDAY
 PRICES WOULD INCREASE AND GROWTH WOULD STALL ECONOMISTS PREDICT
 THEY HAVE LONG KNOWN THAT BUT IT HAD BEEN ACADEMIC BECAUSE THE YEN SEEMED CAPABLE ONLY OF RISING
 NOW THE YEN HAS SHOWN IT CAN FALL TOO AND THAT WORRIES THE JAPANESE
 NO ONE CAN PREDICT HOW MUCH LONGER THE GOOD TIMES WILL ROLL
 BUT JAPAN HAS HAD ALL OF ONE RECESSION IN ALMOST FORTY YEARS
 AND ECONOMISTS DON'T SEE ANOTHER SOON THEY FORECAST SLOW BUT SUSTAINED GROWTH THROUGH FISCAL NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE
 WHAT DOES IT MEAN
 DAVID LIPPMANN AN ANALYST AT DREXEL BURNHAM LAMBERT INCORPORATED ASKED
 THEY'RE SPENDING A TON OF MONEY TO PROMOTE IT
 IN FAIRNESS WE OUGHT TO KEEP WHAT HAS BEEN COLLECTED HE SAYS
 WE HAD FIFTY YEARS OF PRECEDENT THAT A FLAT TAX WAS LEGAL
 AT THE TIME IT WAS ENACTED WE HAD NO BASIS TO BELIEVE IT WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL
 FANNIE MAE A FEDERALLY CHARTERED SHAREHOLDER OWNED COMPANY OPERATES A SECONDARY MARKET FOR HOME MORTGAGES
 IN THE YEAR EARLIER THIRD QUARTER IT POSTED NET OF SIXTY POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVENTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE
 IN THE RECENT QUARTER IT PURCHASED FOUR POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF MORTGAGES DOWN SLIGHTLY FROM FOUR POINT NINE BILLION DOLLARS THE YEAR BEFORE
 COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE MORTGAGES FROM LENDERS FELL TO THREE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIX POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS
 UNTIL RECENTLY OFFICIALS RULED OUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE LAW
 SOME FOREIGN FIRMS WON'T CONSIDER JOINT VENTURES WITHOUT CAST IRON GUARANTEES INVESTMENTS WILL BE PROTECTED FROM CHANGES IN
 SUCH WORRIES HAVE A HISTORICAL BASIS SEVERAL WESTERN FIRMS THAT HELPED THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT AFTER THE NINETEEN SEVENTEEN REVOLUTION LATER HAD THEIR ASSETS HERE CONFISCATED
 YOU CAN LIVE VERY WELL ON ONE PERCENT TO TWO PERCENT OF THE MARKET SAYS JAMES CONLEY PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
 WE WILL TAKE SMALL CONTRACTS THAT NOBODY ELSE WILL TAKE
 THERE'S NO ONE ELSE IN THE INDUSTRY THINKING ON THE SCALE WE DO
 REPRESENTATIVE ROSTENKOWSKI SAID VICE PRESIDENT GEORGE BUSH'S TAX PROPOSALS WOULD COST ABOUT FIFTY BILLION DOLLARS
 THAT'S A RAID ON THE TREASURY
 WHERE DO WE GET THIS MONEY HE ASKED
 BUSH CAMPAIGN OFFICIALS DECLINED TO RESPOND TO MR. ROSTENKOWSKI
 UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS TENTATIVELY PRICED A PROPOSED ONE HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLAR OFFERING OF MORTGAGE REVENUE BONDS BY THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCE AGENCY
 THE OFFERING INCLUDES ZERO COUPON BONDS CALLED CAPITAL APPRECIATION BONDS
 YIELDS RANGE FROM FOUR POINT EIGHT PERCENT IN NINETEEN NINETY TO SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT ON ZERO COUPON BONDS DUE IN TWO THOUSAND TWO
 THE NEED FOR ECONOMY HAS ALSO HELD TO A HANDFUL THE EXPENSIVE BUT ALL IMPORTANT LONGITUDINAL SURVEYS THAT FOLLOW A GROUP OF PEOPLE OVER MANY YEARS
 FOR EXAMPLE THE GOVERNMENT WOULD LIKE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT THE WAY ELDERLY PEOPLE MOVE FROM INDEPENDENT LIVING TO COMMUNITY CARE TO PERHAPS A NURSING HOME OR HOSPITAL
 WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE PLANNERS COULD BETTER DETERMINE WHETHER MORE COMMUNITY CARE FACILITIES COULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR NURSING HOMES OR HOSPITALS
 SMALL INVESTORS WILL ALSO BE AFFECTED TRADERS SAID
 DAILY PRICE LIMITS WERE IN PART INTENDED TO ALLOW SUCH INVESTORS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MARKET BY LIMITING THEIR LOSSES ON ANY GIVEN DAY
 BUT BIGGER PLAYERS FELT THESE RULES LIMITED THEIR POTENTIAL GAINS AND ABILITY TO GET IN AND OUT OF THE MARKET
 FOR INVESTORS WILLING TO TAKE MORE RISK THE NEARBY CONTRACT MONTH WHICH TRADED WITHOUT PRICE LIMITS WAS ONE ALTERNATIVE
 THE DIRECTOR BARRY F. COHEN SOLD ABOUT SIX HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND SHARES TO A SINGLE BUYER ACCORDING TO SYNALLOY
 MR. COHEN ASKED THE COMPANY NOT TO IDENTIFY THE BUYER WHO IS EXPECTED TO DISCLOSE THE STAKE LATER THIS WEEK IN A FILING WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
 SYNALLOY HAS THREE MILLION EIGHT HUNDRED FORTY THREE THOUSAND SHARES OUTSTANDING
 U. S. CAR SALES FELL TEN POINT ONE PERCENT IN EARLY NOVEMBER FROM A YEAR AGO
 THOUGH THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE THE STOCK MARKET PLUNGE HAD AFFECTED SALES THE OUTLOOK REMAINS UNCERTAIN
 CHRYSLER REDUCED SOME PRICES ON FRIDAY
 AND LOUISIANA IS BROKE THE NATION'S WORST VICTIM OF THE OIL PRICE COLLAPSE
 THIS YEAR'S CASH SHORTFALL HAS SWOLLEN TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS
 RECENTLY STANDARD AND POOR'S CORPORATION PILED ON YET ANOTHER LAST PLACE DISTINCTION AWARDING LOUISIANA THE LOWEST BOND RATING EVER ASSIGNED A STATE
 BUSH INDUSTRIES INCORPORATED JAMESTOWN N. Y. SAID ITS BOARD DECLARED A THREE FOR TWO STOCK SPLIT OF ITS CLASS A. AND CLASS B. COMMON SHARES
 THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE APRIL EIGHTEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD APRIL FOURTH
 THE COMPANY A MAKER OF READY TO ASSEMBLE FURNITURE SAID IT HAS A TOTAL OF THREE MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING
 THAT'S HOPEFUL NEWS IN DOWNTRODDEN TEXAS BUT A RESCUE OF THE STATE'S LARGEST BANKING CONCERN BY THE NATION'S LARGEST BANKING COMPANY IS FAR FROM A DONE DEAL
 YES PEOPLE ARE DOWN THERE LOOKING AT IT A HIGH RANKING CITICORP EXECUTIVE SAID YESTERDAY BUT WE LOOK AT EVERYTHING
 CLEARLY THE FEDS AREN'T GOING TO GIVE THIS BANK AWAY
 I GIVE THIS A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE OF COMING TO ANYTHING
 AT A MEETING OF CAMPAIGN ADVISERS IN KENNEBUNKPORT MAINE EARLIER THIS SUMMER BUSH ECONOMISTS MICHAEL BOSKIN AND MARTIN FELDSTEIN BOTH ARGUED AGAINST USING THE JOBS NUMBER
 THEIR ADVICE WAS APPARENTLY UNHEEDED
 LAST WEEK MR. BOSKIN GAMELY DEFENDED THE THIRTY MILLION FIGURE
 MR. KEAN'S TERM EXPIRES IN NINETEEN NINETY AND STATE LAW PRECLUDES HIS RUNNING AGAIN
 BUT CONSERVATIVE ACTIVISTS INSIST HE WON'T BE ABLE TO MOVE INTO THE NATIONAL LIMELIGHT
 HE HAS NO FUTURE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY UNLESS HE CHANGES HIS VIEWS AND BECOMES A CONSERVATIVE ARGUES MR. VIGUERIE
 HE MIGHT DO WELL IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
 EARLIER THIS WEEK THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION GAVE UPJOHN FINAL APPROVAL TO MARKET MINOXIDIL AS A TOPICAL DRUG
 UPJOHN EXPECTS TO LAUNCH THE DRUG UNDER THE NAME ROGAINE IN LATE SEPTEMBER AS THE NATION'S FIRST PRESCRIBED TREATMENT FOR HAIR LOSS
 SOME INDUSTRY ANALYSTS SAY THE BABY BOOMERS COULD HELP BOOST SALES BY YEAR END TO MORE THAN DOUBLE THE DRUG'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WORLD WIDE SALES
 MR. HARNISCH SAID THE TURMOIL HASN'T AFFECTED THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS OF FORSTMANN LEFF WHICH CURRENTLY MANAGES FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN CLIENT ASSETS

 THE FEMALE PRODUCES A LITTER OF TWO TO FOUR YOUNG IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER
 NUMEROUS WORKS OF ART ARE BASED ON THE STORY OF THE SACRIFICE OF ISAAC
 THEIR SOLUTION REQUIRES DEVELOPMENT OF THE HUMAN CAPACITY FOR SOCIAL INTEREST
 HIS MOST SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC PUBLICATIONS WERE STUDIES OF BIRDS AND ANIMALS
 IN RECENT YEARS SHE HAS PRIMARILY APPEARED IN TELEVISION FILMS SUCH AS LITTLE GLORIA

 THE SOUTH CAROLINA EDUCATIONAL RADIO NETWORK HAS WON NATIONAL BROADCASTING AWARDS
 A TANKER IS A SHIP DESIGNED TO CARRY LARGE VOLUMES OF OIL OR OTHER LIQUID CARGO
 THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSE THIS HIGH PRESSURE
 IN MID JANUARY THE COMPANY SAID ITS BANKS AGREED TO A REDUCED REPAYMENT OF THEIR LOANS WHICH TOTAL TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS
 BUT THE COMPANY ALSO NEEDS TO SWAP ITS CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY OUTSTANDING FOR NEW SECURITIES
 ANOTHER RESTRUCTURING PLAN FAILED TO WIN APPROVAL LAST YEAR
 ALSO UNDER THE PROPOSAL THE MINISTRY IS SEEKING TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN ITS INSURANCE COVERAGE OF DIRECT OVERSEAS INVESTMENT BY JAPANESE COMPANIES
 IT WANTS TO EXTEND COVERAGE TO SUCH BUSINESS DAMAGE AS BANKRUPTCIES BY JAPANESE COMPANIES' FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES
 AT PRESENT COVERAGE IS LIMITED TO DAMAGE CAUSED UNDER SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS POLITICAL UNREST
 OTHER PENTAGON ORDERS HAVE GONE OVERSEAS IN THE ABSENCE OF AN EQUIVALENT U. S. PRODUCT
 WE NEEDED A SMALL CARGO PLANE THAT COULD FLY SPARE ENGINES FROM ONE EUROPEAN BASE TO ANOTHER AN AIR FORCE SPOKESMAN EXPLAINS
 THE BRITISH AND THE SPANIARDS WERE THE ONLY BIDDERS
 IT'S UNCLEAR HOW WILLING THE COMMUNITIES WILL BE TO PARTICIPATE
 SEVERAL SAID THEY WOULD CONSIDER THE PROPOSAL BUT WERE UNLIKELY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF IT
 A H. U. D. SPOKESMAN JACK FLYNN ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE RESPONSE RATE IS EXPECTED TO BE LOW POSSIBLY AS LOW AS FIVE PERCENT
 OPENING SUNDAY SERVICES TO BLACKS IS EXPECTED TO BE EVEN HARDER HE SAYS
 I'VE BEEN ASKED DOMINEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF TWENTY BLACKS COME TO CHURCH
 I SAY THEY WOULD BE WELCOME
 THEN I'M ASKED WHERE WOULD THEY SIT
 UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING THE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF A. H. ROBINS BY AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS HELPED PUSH BOTH STOCKS DOWN
 ROBINS DROPPED ONE AND FIVE EIGHTHS TO TWENTY TWO AND SEVEN EIGHTHS AND AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS FELL ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS TO EIGHTY TWO AND ONE QUARTER
 MEANWHILE UNILEVER WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED AS A POTENTIAL RIVAL BIDDER FOR ROBINS ROSE FOUR AND THREE QUARTERS TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY
 INTEREST RATES SURGED ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS YESTERDAY AT THE GOVERNMENT'S REGULAR WEEKLY AUCTION
 THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW THIRTEEN WEEK BILLS ROSE TO FIVE POINT SEVEN TWO PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT FIVE EIGHT PERCENT AT THE PREVIOUS WEEK'S SALE
 THE AVERAGE RATE ON NEW TWENTY SIX WEEK TREASURY BILLS INCREASED TO FIVE POINT SIX NINE PERCENT FROM FIVE POINT FIVE NINE PERCENT A WEEK EARLIER
 LAWRENCE A. KUDLOW CHIEF ECONOMIST OF BEAR STEARNS AND COMPANY SAID THE ECONOMY'S GROWTH RATE WILL ACCELERATE THIS YEAR AND INTEREST RATES WILL CLIMB
 I THINK FED POLICY RIGHT NOW IS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED BUT THE NEXT CHANGE IN POLICY WILL BE TOWARDS RESTRAINT HE SAID
 SUCH A MOVE COULD COME IN MARCH OR APRIL HE ADDED
 AN ADMINISTRATION OFFICIAL SAID IT WASN'T CERTAIN WHETHER THE REPORT IMMEDIATELY WOULD CHANGE WHITE HOUSE POLICY
 BUT HE SAID HE BELIEVED IT WOULD INCREASE OUTSIDE PRESSURE FROM CONGRESS AND THE PUBLIC TO TAKE A TOUGHER APPROACH TOWARD SOUTH AFRICA
 THESE ARE REASONABLE MEN WHO ARE SAYING THE PRESIDENT WAS WRONG THE OFFICIAL SAID
 A FIRST INTERSTATE ADVISER SAID A FUTURE OFFER WAS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE STRATEGY IS SO APPEALING AND SOUND
 BUT THE ADVISER ADDED THIS REALLY IS A WITHDRAWAL FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE
 YOU COULD SEE A RESUMPTION BUT IT WON'T BE TOMORROW OR NEXT WEEK OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT
 BUT MOST SUBJECTS DON'T GET THE ALCOHOL OR THE BOAT
 TAKE DAVID ISRAEL A TWENTY SIX YEAR OLD GRADUATE STUDENT IN PHYSIOLOGY
 LAST OCTOBER FOR THE STANDARD ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR FEE HE JUMPED INTO LAKE SUPERIOR WEARING ONLY HIS STREET CLOTHES
 HE CONCEDES IT WAS CRAZY
 HE ALSO CONCEDES THAT IT WASN'T HIS FIRST TIME
 ATTORNEYS FOR THE MINORITY SHAREHOLDERS SAID THEY WILL PURSUE NEW TERMS FOR THE BUYOUT IN COURT
 ONCE THE THREAT OF INJUNCTION WAS LIFTED TEXAS AIR COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION UNDER ITS PLAN TO PAY SIXTEEN DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE FOR THE OUTSTANDING SHARES
 WE'LL LET THE COURTS DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR SHARES SAID MR. KLEIN
 THE SAVINGS BANK HOLDING COMPANY SAID IT EXPECTS TO ISSUE ABOUT ONE POINT TWO FIVE RIGHTS FOR EACH COMMON SHARE HELD
 IT SAID THE FIGURE MAY BE ADJUSTED TO AS LOW AS ONE POINT ONE SEVEN RIGHTS FOR EACH SHARE
 EACH RIGHT WILL ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO ACQUIRE ONE TRANSCAPITAL COMMON SHARE AT A PRICE TO BE DETERMINED JUST BEFORE THE OFFERING
 A HALFWAY POLICY LIKE BOEING'S FOR INSTANCE OFTEN JUST AGGRAVATES NONSMOKERS
 BUT A TOTAL BAN RISKS OFFENDING SMOKERS
 MANAGERS ARE ALSO GRAPPLING WITH SUCH INTRICACIES AS SHOULD A CIGARETTE VENDING MACHINE STAY
 SHOULD SMOKING BE ALLOWED IN COMPANY VEHICLES
 WHAT SHOULD BE THE POLICY WHEN THERE ARE MANY SMALL FAR FLUNG OFFICES
 PEOPLE ARE BEING MUCH MORE CAREFUL ABOUT WHO THEY'RE TALKING TO AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING THIS YEAR HE SAID
 YOU HAVE TO ASSUME THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS WELL REPRESENTED HERE
 DREXEL IS A NEW YORK BASED INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM BUT ITS ENORMOUSLY PROFITABLE JUNK BOND OPERATIONS ARE BASED HERE
 BRITAIN PROTESTED THE ABDUCTION OF ONE OF ITS DIPLOMATS TO IRAN'S SENIOR ENVOY
 IRAN SAID CHARGES WERE TO BE MADE AGAINST BRITAIN'S SECOND MOST SENIOR DIPLOMAT IN TEHRAN AFTER HE WAS ABDUCTED AND FREED TWENTY FOUR HOURS LATER LAST WEEK
 LONDON SAID THAT ON NO ACCOUNT WOULD IT ANSWER ANY SUCH CHARGES
 YOUR JUNE THIRTIETH EDITORIAL THE DEMOCRATS' EUROPEAN DISEASE IS LARGELY ON THE
 EUROPE'S RIGID LABOR LAWS APPEAR TO HAVE TURNED LABOR INTO A FIXED
 WHILE THESE LAWS MAY PROTECT THE LUCKY WORKERS WITH JOBS THEY TEND TO MILITATE AGAINST YOUNG WORKERS LOOKING FOR WORK
 THE RELATIVELY HIGH EUROPEAN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ESPECIALLY AMONG YOUNG PEOPLE SUPPORT THIS HYPOTHESIS
 THE PROSECUTOR PROBABLY WILL DELAY SOME MAJOR DECISIONS UNTIL PUBLIC REACTION TO THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS DIES DOWN
 BUT CONSERVATIVES' URGINGS THAT REAGAN PARDON NORTH AND POINDEXTER COULD PROMPT WALSH TO STEP UP HIS EFFORTS OFFICIALS FAMILIAR WITH THE INQUIRY SAY
 HE IS KNOWN TO BE STUBBORN
 HARVEY A PORTFOLIO MANAGER FOR THE INVESTMENT ARM OF INTEGRATED RESOURCES SAID THAT THE MARKET WAS OVERRIPE FOR A REBOUND
 IT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO SEE SIX CONSECUTIVE DAYS OF DECLINES HE SAID
 AND THE DECLINES IN THE PAST FIVE DAYS HE OBSERVED HAVE OFTEN BEEN OF THROWAWAY OR CLIMACTIC PROPORTIONS
 SOME STOCKS HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF DURING THE LAST FEW WEEKS
 HIS FORTY WORKERS ARE STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT AND HE HAS TRIED WITHOUT SUCCESS TO GET EXTRA HELP
 HE HAS ADVERTISED IN NEWSPAPERS BOUGHT TIME ON RADIO EVEN PUT UP POSTERS
 BUT WITH THE LOCAL ECONOMY BOOMING IN EVERY SECTOR HE IS JUST ONE EMPLOYER AMONG THOUSANDS BEGGING FOR WORKERS
 HONG KONG'S JUNE UNEMPLOYMENT WAS ONE POINT EIGHT PERCENT OF THE LABOR FORCE THE LOWEST SINCE THE GOVERNMENT BEGAN TO COLLECT SUCH FIGURES IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE
 BUT MR. QUINON SAYS HIS CLIENT'S REPUTATION IS VASTLY EXAGGERATED
 HE'S NOT PUBLIC ENEMY NUMBER ONE HE INSISTS
 A REAL GENTLEMAN ADDS MR. SHOHAT
 MR. ROBERTSON FOUNDED HIS CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING NETWORK IN NINETEEN FIFTY NINE
 IN THE YEARS SINCE ON HIS SEVEN HUNDRED CLUB SHOW HE HAS DISCUSSED HUNDREDS OF SUBJECTS WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN MILLIONS OF WORDS
 HE HAS WRITTEN FIVE BOOKS DELIVERED COUNTLESS SPEECHES
 THE RECORD RIVALS THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES
 SOME MARKET WATCHERS BELIEVE SOME OF THESE COMPANIES MIGHT STILL BE INTERESTED IN BENEFICIAL
 FOR INSTANCE TRANSAMERICA CORPORATION WAS WIDELY RUMORED TO HAVE MADE A HIGHLY CONDITIONAL BID OF SEVENTY FIVE DOLLARS A SHARE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX THAT BENEFICIAL ULTIMATELY REJECTED
 TRANSAMERICA SAYS ITS POLICY IS TO REFRAIN FROM COMMENTING ON MARKET RUMORS
 THE NEW PRODUCTS WHICH WILL BE SOLD BY LOS ANGELES BASED CARNATION UNIT POSE A TRICKY MARKETING CHALLENGE
 IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES CONTROVERSY ABOUT INFANT FORMULA MARKETING PRACTICES LED TO A WORLD WIDE BOYCOTT OF ALL ITS PRODUCTS

 HOW SUCCESSFUL THE NEW MANAGING DIRECTOR WILL BE REMAINS TO BE SEEN
 WHILE LIKELY TO DISCUSS A BROAD RANGE OF PROBLEMS THE FINANCE MINISTERS AREN'T EXPECTED TO TAKE ANY ACTIONS AT THEIR MEETING THIS WEEK
 ANY CHANGES PROBABLY WILL EVOLVE SLOWLY ANALYSTS SAY
 A SPOKESMAN FOR THE AIRLINE SAID IT STUDIED A NUMBER OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS BEFORE CHOOSING I. B. M. FOR ITS TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE
 THE COMPANY CURRENTLY DOESN'T USE PERSONAL COMPUTERS FOR THE SYSTEM
 I. B. M. INTRODUCED FOUR NEW PERSONAL COMPUTER MODELS LAST WEEK
 COMPANIES EVENTUALLY WILL PAY A BASE RATE OF FORTY FIVE PERCENT IN TAXES ON THEIR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN INCOME
 BUT THE ESTIMATED TAXES THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PAY IN ADVANCE WILL BE CALCULATED AS IF THE RATE WERE FORTY TWO PERCENT
 THAT WILL GIVE A SMALL BOOST TO CORPORATE TREASURIES ALTHOUGH THEY WILL HAVE TO PAY THE FULL AMOUNT EVENTUALLY AFTER THEY SUBMIT THEIR TAX RETURNS NEXT YEAR
 CAR SALES ROSE NINETEEN POINT THREE PERCENT IN LATE MARCH BUOYED BY INCENTIVES
 THE FIGURES AVERAGED OUT TO THE STRONGEST DAILY SALES RATE SINCE DECEMBER
 SALES OF IMPORTED MODELS REMAINED SLUGGISH
 B. I. W. SAID BUSINESS OF SOME OF ITS OPERATIONS RECENTLY IMPROVED
 THE BACKLOG OF ITS EAST COAST OPERATIONS ROSE TO ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN DECEMBER FROM SIX POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER THE COMPANY SAID
 BACKLOGS OF ITS BRITISH AND CANADIAN OPERATIONS ALSO HAVE RECENTLY RISEN B. I. W. SAID
 SPECIFICALLY THE UNION SAID IT WAS PROPOSING TO PURCHASE ALL OF THE ASSETS OF UNITED AIRLINES INCLUDING PLANES GATES FACILITIES AND LANDING RIGHTS
 THE RAISED A QUESTION IN SOME MINDS AS TO WHY THE UNION DIDN'T PROPOSE TO ACQUIRE ALL OF THE U. A. L. AND THEN SELL THE UNRELATED AIRLINE ASSETS
 THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT SUCH A COURSE MIGHT BE LESS EXPENSIVE
 IF MR. MURDOCH DECIDES TO GET RID OF IT WE WOULD BE A BIDDER HE SAID
 MR. NICHOLAS SAID TIME IS ALSO INTERESTED IN SIMILAR OPERATIONS OF PUBLISHER MACMILLAN INCORPORATED
 BUT HE SAID THAT TIME HASN'T APPROACHED EITHER MACMILLAN OR NEWS CORPORATION ABOUT ITS INTEREST
 IN ADDITION I. B. M.'S PRICING STRATEGY WOULD HURT COMPETITORS
 FOR EXAMPLE THE COMPANY PLANS BIG DISCOUNTS ON THE NEW ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE DOLLAR MACHINE FOR SCHOOLS A MAIN APPLE MARKET
 ONE OF THE NEW P. C.S OFFERS ALMOST DOUBLE THE MEMORY AND SLIGHTLY MORE STORAGE FOR ELEVEN PERCENT LESS THAN THE COMPETING COMPAQ MACHINE
 I. B. M. P. C.S TRADITIONALLY ARE PRICED HIGHER THAN RIVAL BRANDS WHICH TYPICALLY MUST UNDERCUT I. B. M. PRICES BY FIFTEEN PERCENT
 THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL WAS THE FINAL STEP THE COMPANY NEEDED TO PROCEED WITH THE PLAN
 NEVADA OFFICIALS AND HOLIDAY SHAREHOLDERS ALREADY HAD APPROVED IT
 HOLIDAY BASED IN MEMPHIS HAS CASINO OPERATIONS IN NEW JERSEY AND NEVADA
 LUCKY STORES INCORPORATED SAID ITS BOARD APPROVED THE PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED REDEMPTION OF THIRTY EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION STOCK PURCHASE RIGHTS AT FIVE CENTS PER RIGHT
 THE RIGHTS ISSUED LAST AUGUST WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE GROCERY CHAIN'S COMMON STOCK
 THE REDEMPTION PRICE WILL BE PAID APRIL TWENTIETH TO STOCK OF RECORD APRIL THIRTEENTH
 THE ADMINISTRATION MOVES TO USE THE TURMOIL AND SUBSEQUENT RISE IN THE PRIME RATE TO ARGUE AGAINST TOUGH TRADE LEGISLATION
 TREASURY CHIEF BAKER TELLS CAPITOL HILL THE STOCK MARKET SLIDE SHOWED THAT INVESTORS DON'T WANT PROTECTIONISM
 THE REACTION INCREASES PRESSURE ON HOUSE DEMOCRATS PUSHING A TOUGH BILL
 THE FINANCIAL SERVICES CONCERN DIDN'T SPECIFY WHAT FIRST PERIOD RESULTS WERE
 THE NINETEEN SIX FOUR QUARTER EARNINGS INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE OF TWO POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR TWENTY EIGHT CENTS A SHARE
 IN THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX FIRST QUARTER THE COMPANY EARNED FOUR POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY FOUR CENTS A SHARE
 JAY JACOBS INCORPORATED INITIAL OFFERING OF ONE POINT FIVE MILLION COMMON SHARES
 OF THE TOTAL ONE MILLION SHARES WILL BE OFFERED BY THE COMPANY AND THE REST BY HOLDERS VIA ALEX
 BROWN AND SONS INCORPORATED
 FIRST BOSTON OUTLINED SEVERAL SPECIFIC FACTORS UNDERLYING ITS ANALYSIS OF STANDARD IN ITS LETTER TO THE COMPANY'S OUTSIDE DIRECTORS
 IT SAID GOLDMAN UNDERESTIMATED THE OPERATING INCOME OF STANDARD'S REFINING AND MARKETING BUSINESS BY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
 IT ALSO SAID GOLDMAN UNDERESTIMATED STANDARD'S PROBABLE RESERVES OF OIL IN THE CRUCIAL ALASKAN PRUDHOE BAY AREA BY FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE MILLION BARRELS
 KAISERTECH SAID JAMES S. PASMAN JUNIOR FIFTY SIX WILL SUCCEED MR. MAIER AS CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF KAISER ALUMINUM
 MR. PASMAN IS A FORMER VICE CHAIRMAN DIRECTOR AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER OF ALUMINUM COMPANY OF AMERICA
 KAISERTECH DIDN'T NAME SUCCESSORS FOR MR. MAIER IN HIS POSTS AT THE PARENT
 DEALERS SAID THE MARKET ROSE GRADUALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS PARTICIPANTS WERE REASSURED BY THE DOLLAR'S STEADINESS
 THE DOLLAR'S SLIDE EARLIER IN THE WEEK CAUSED ONE HUNDRED SHARE INDEX TO SLUMP SIXTY POINT EIGHT POINTS TUESDAY
 THE DOLLAR WAS SUPPORTED AGAIN WEDNESDAY BY REPORTS OF INTERVENTION BY SEVERAL EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANKS AND THE U. S. FEDERAL RESERVE
 IN THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY SOARING DEMAND HAS CREATED A SPECULATIVE MARKET IN RAW MATERIALS
 TRAFFIC THROUGH HONG KONG'S CONTAINER PORT IS RACING AHEAD OF PROJECTIONS
 IN THE CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT OFFICES THAT STOOD VACANT NOT LONG AGO ARE COMMANDING PREMIUM RENTS
 THEY ALSO CONTEND THE BUDGETARY QUAGMIRE WAS PARTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR OCTOBER'S STOCK MARKET DISASTER
 BUT MR. KELLNER OF MANUFACTURERS HANOVER AND MANY OTHERS STRONGLY DISAGREE
 THEY NOTE THAT THE STOCK MARKET SURGED FOR YEARS EVEN AS THE BUDGET DEFICIT WAS SOARING AND THAT THE DEFICIT LATELY HAS BEEN SHRINKING NOT EXPANDING
 BY MOST ACCOUNTS THE PAST WEEK'S DOLLAR SCARE COMMUNICATED ITS MESSAGE
 FED OFFICIALS TOLD THIS NEWSPAPER WEDNESDAY THAT THEY WEREN'T ABOUT TO MAKE ANY PRECIPITOUS CHANGES IN MONETARY POLICY AND THAT THEY TOO WORRIED ABOUT THE DOLLAR
 AND THE PRESIDENT FINALLY MADE CLEAR HE DOESN'T WANT TO PRESIDE OVER ANY CHARTER STYLE DOLLAR CRISIS
 BUT IT WAS ATLANTIC CITY WHERE MR. WYNN HIT THE JACKPOT
 IN NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HE PAID EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A BROAD WALK MOTEL TORE IT DOWN AND RAISED A FIVE HUNDRED ROOM HOTEL AND CASINO
 IT OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND QUICKLY BECAME ONE OF THE MOST PROFITABLE PLACES IN TOWN
 THE TAX CUTS PREMATURELY HAILED AS TAX REFORM BY ANALYSTS AND ACADEMICS SEEM LIKELY TO BE FINANCED BY BRITAIN'S ROARING ECONOMIC EXPANSION
 THANKS TO SURGING PERSONAL AND CORPORATE EARNINGS TREASURY COFFERS OVERFLOW WITH AN ESTIMATED EXTRA TEN BILLION POUNDS
 USING THIS REVENUE BONANZA TO GIVE BRITONS SOME OF THEIR MONEY BACK MR. LAWSON WILL HAVE ENOUGH LEFT TO CREATE BRITAIN'S FIRST BUDGET SURPLUS IN YEARS
 COLOROLL URGED CROWTHER TO ACCEPT ITS OFFER WHICH IT SAID IT WOULDN'T SWEETEN
 IT SAID THERE IS NO COMMERCIAL LOGIC IN A COMBINATION OF CROWTHER AND ROBINSON
 CROWTHER HAD NO IMMEDIATE COMMENT
 THE ANTI ABORTION INTERESTS BELIEVE THAT REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME THE BID TO BE HEARD BY THE SUPREME COURT CAN ONLY STRENGTHEN THEIR HAND

 THE THRIFT BAILOUT BILL WAS SENT TO BUSH WHO IS EXPECTED TO SIGN IT AS SOON AS WEDNESDAY
 CONGRESS APPROVED THE LANDMARK MEASURE NEAR MIDNIGHT FRIDAY FOLLOWING A LAST MINUTE COMPROMISE OVER HOW TO FINANCE THE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLAR RESCUE

 THAT WOULD ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY ALL THE TRADING VOLUME YESTERDAY IN B. P.'S PARTLY PAID SHARES ON LONDON'S STOCK EXCHANGE
 THE VOLUME WHICH TALLIES BOTH STOCK PURCHASES AND SALES WAS A HEAVY SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION SHARES
 FOR THE TOP STORIES THOUGH THE EDITORS WENT FOR THE BIG EVENTS THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS PLACED FIRST
 SECOND BY A HAIR WAS THE STOCK MARKET CRASH WHILE THE PROBLEMS OF THE DOLLAR DIDN'T MAKE THE TOP TWENTY
 THIRD CAME THE SUMMIT
 THE BIG STORIES WE TAKE IT WERE THOSE WHOSE ULTIMATE MEANING HAS NO DOUBT ESCAPED MOST AMERICANS

 WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS WE SAVED THIS COMPANY AND ARE REBUILDING IT
 FOR ITS EFFORTS DREXEL WILL GET ACCORDING TO WESTERN UNION'S PROXY STATEMENT A TWENTY FIVE POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR FEE
 FOR NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN THE INSTITUTE PREDICTS GROSS SALES TO INVESTORS OF STOCK BOND AND INCOME FUNDS WILL TOTAL ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS
 THAT'S DOWN FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX SALES OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS BUT HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER YEAR
 THE BULK OF THE SALES HOWEVER CAME IN THE FIRST HALF OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN
 THE GROSS FIGURES AREN'T ADJUSTED FOR INVESTORS' REDEMPTIONS WHICH TOTALED A RECORD ONE HUNDRED SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THROUGH NOVEMBER
 TRADERS SAID THE REASON BEHIND THE FIRST HOUR FOCUS IS THE ACTION IN THE DOLLAR
 THE DOLLAR IS STILL THE KEY SAID JACK P. BAKER HEAD OF BLOCK TRADING AT SHEARSON LEHMAN BROTHERS INCORPORATED NEW YORK
 YESTERDAY THE DOLLAR EASED SLIGHTLY AGAINST MOST MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES CHEERING SOME STOCK MARKET PLAYERS WITH ITS RELATIVE STABILITY
 THE NOVEMBER DROP BROUGHT THE INDEX TO ONE HUNDRED NINETY POINT TWO PERCENT OF ITS NINETEEN SIXTY SEVEN AVERAGE FROM ONE HUNDRED NINETY THREE POINT FIVE PERCENT IN OCTOBER
 THE OCTOBER RISE WAS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT DROP
 IN YESTERDAY'S RELEASE THE DEPARTMENT ALSO REVISED THE SEPTEMBER PERFORMANCE TO A ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT RISE AFTER PREVIOUSLY REPORTING IT AS UNCHANGED
 THE DEPARTMENT INITIALLY REPORTED THAT OCTOBER HOME SALES DROPPED ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT
 THE NOVEMBER DECLINE BROUGHT SALES TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF SIX HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND UNITS FROM SIX HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO THOUSAND IN OCTOBER

 RATES ON SHORT TERM TREASURY BILLS ALSO FELL YESTERDAY
 THE LATEST THREE MONTH RATE DECLINED TO FIVE POINT SEVEN OH PERCENT BID FROM FIVE POINT EIGHT FIVE PERCENT TUESDAY
 THE LATEST SIX MONTH BILL RATE FELL TO SIX POINT ONE SEVEN PERCENT BID FROM SIX POINT TWO EIGHT PERCENT
 THE LARGE DECLINE IN THE LEADING INDICATORS REFLECTED THE STOCK MARKET'S PLUNGE AND MODEST WEAKNESS IN OTHER AREAS
 THE DECLINE WAS SLIGHTLY LARGER THAN THE ONE POINT FIVE PERCENT SLUMP THAT HAD BEEN EXPECTED BY MANY ANALYSTS
 IT FOLLOWED A REVISED INCREASE OF ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN OCTOBER
 INDIVIDUALS FAMILIAR WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS SAID MR. BILZERIAN MET IN NEW YORK WITH MESA REPRESENTATIVES YESTERDAY TRYING TO REACH A FINANCING AGREEMENT

 JOSEPH A. STANISLAW SENIOR ANALYST FOR CAMBRIDGE ENERGY RESEARCH ASSOCIATES ALSO CAUTIONED THE INDUSTRY AGAINST PUTTING TOO MUCH FAITH IN OPEC

 IT WAS A CONTROVERSIAL DECISION SAYS PAUL GOLDSTEIN DISTRICT MANAGER OF THE COMMUNITY BOARD
 SOME BOARD MEMBERS FELT THE SIGNS WEREN'T APPROPRIATE
 SOME ARGUED THAT THEY MIGHT CAUSE THE OPPOSITE REACTION AND ENCOURAGE MORE COMMENTS TO BE MADE AT WOMEN
 I DO RECALL THOUGH THAT MOST OF THE OPPOSITION CAME FROM MALE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD

 THERE ARE NO LAWYERS WHO FOCUS ONLY ON THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE LAW SAYS PROFESSOR MAEDA
 THERE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN ANY CASES
 IT WOULD BE TOUGH TO START A LAW FIRM AND CONCENTRATE ON SECURITIES LAW
 THOSE ARE THE FACTS BUT IT TURNS OUT THE REASON ISN'T BECAUSE GEORGE WAS THERE
 THE FASTER ACTION ON SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS AND H. U. D. LOANS IS LARGELY DUE TO NEW COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY SOME OF WHICH BEGAN IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES
 AND THE SPEED UP IN PASSPORT PROCESSING IS LARGELY THE RESULT OF STATE DEPARTMENT EFFORTS BEGUN IN NINETEEN SIXTY EIGHT
 MR. BUSH WASN'T ANY PART OF THIS EITHER A STATE DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL SAYS
 FEE REQUESTS AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY LAW FILING AMOUNTED TO FOUR POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FIVE THOUSAND THIRTY ONE HOURS OF WORK
 THE ATTORNEYS WERE GRANTED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS AS WELL AS ONE HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS FOR EXPENSES
 HOWEVER ONLY EIGHT OF THE NINETEEN FIRMS WERE GRANTED FEE PAYMENTS FOR WORK DONE AFTER THE BANKRUPTCY LAW FILING
 JOE ALLEN IS THE KIND OF CUSTOMER THAT HAS CRUISE SHIP OPERATORS FLOATING ON AIR
 HE'S A LAWYER IN HIS LATE TWENTIES AND AS MR. ALLEN PUTS IT RICH OR AT LEAST HIGHLY PAID
 AND THIS AFTERNOON HE'S SCHEDULED TO SHOVE OFF ON A CRUISE
 MR. GRAMM LEAVES NO DOUBT THAT HIS EYES ARE ON THE WHITE HOUSE
 I'M VERY AMBITIOUS HE SAYS
 ANYBODY WHO'S EVER BEEN ELECTED TO THE CITY COUNCIL THINKS ABOUT BEING PRESIDENT
 PREPAYMENT RISK THE RISK THAT HOMEOWNERS WILL REPAY THE MORTGAGES UNDERLYING THE SECURITIES EITHER FASTER OR SLOWER THAN EXPECTED EXISTS ON ALL MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES
 BUT IN THE PAST YEAR INVESTMENT BANKERS DEVELOPED NEW TYPES OF MORTGAGE BACKED SECURITIES THAT ARE ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO CHANGES IN PREPAYMENT RATES
 IN SOME CASES A MAJOR SHIFT IN PREPAYMENT RATES CAN CUT THE YIELD ON THE SECURITIES BY SEVERAL PERCENTAGE POINTS
 INDEED INVESTORS COULD EVEN END UP RECEIVING LESS THAN WHAT THEY ORIGINALLY INVESTED
 AND WITH GOOD REASON
 LAST YEAR THE LONE STAR STATE HAD THE DUBIOUS HONOR OF LEADING THE NATION IN BANK FAILURES
 ITS THRIFT INDUSTRY IS REELING FROM THE STATE'S REAL ESTATE COLLAPSE
 AND FEDERAL REGULATORS ARE CRACKING DOWN ON SOME OF THE STATE'S MOST TROUBLED INSTITUTIONS
 EXPENSES FROM THE DELAYED NINE MILE POINT TWO NUCLEAR PLANT ACCOUNTED FOR TWO HUNDRED SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE WRITE OFF
 REGULATORS AREN'T ALLOWING THE UTILITY AN EIGHTEEN PERCENT OWNER IN THE PROJECT TO PASS THAT ALONG TO CUSTOMERS
 THE FOUR OTHER UTILITY COMPANY OWNERS WILL ALSO HAVE TO TAKE WRITE OFFS
 BUT THOSE CHANGES AREN'T REQUIRED TO BE MADE UNTIL THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FIRST QUARTER OR UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES EVEN LATER
 UNDER N. R. M.'S MANAGERS ITS COMMON UNITS HAVE HALVED IN PRICE OVER THE PAST YEAR
 THEY MIGHT NOT GO ANYWHERE IF MR. PICKENS IS TOO BUSY WITH MESA TO ADVISE N. R. M. ANALYSTS SAY
 SOME THINK MESA IS EAGER TO BUY A BIG COMPANY WITH LARGE CASH FLOWS IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ITS OWN ANNUAL PAYOUT
 UNDER MR. BAKER AND MR. DARMAN THE DEPUTY TREASURY SECRETARY'S POSITION HAS TAKEN ON EXTENDED IMPORTANCE
 MR. DARMAN PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN FORMULATING THE TREASURY'S POLICY ON TAX OVERHAUL AND AGREEMENTS AMONG THE INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACIES ON INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC POLICY
 BUT IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER MR. MCPHERSON WILL BE CAST IN A SIMILAR ROLE OR WHETHER THE POSITION WILL BE ALTERED TO FIT HIS PARTICULAR QUALIFICATIONS
 MORE AND MORE THOUGH LEGISLATORS ARE LOOKING FOR GUIDANCE TO MR. ARIAS WHOSE CREDIBILITY HAS BEEN ENHANCED ENORMOUSLY BY HIS HARD NOSED ATTITUDE TOWARD LEFTIST NICARAGUA
 VOTING ON CONTRA AID IS A CONTROVERSIAL DECISION MANY DON'T WANT TO MAKE
 WITHOUT THE BLESSING OF MR. ARIAS LAWMAKERS FEAR THEY WILL BE ACCUSED EITHER OF UNDERCUTTING THE CENTRAL AMERICA PEACE PROCESS OR OF SELLING OUT THE CONTRAS
 BUT SOME OPERATORS SAID N. B. C. MAY RUN INTO PROBLEMS
 FOR ONE THING THERE IS CURRENTLY A SHORTAGE OF CHANNEL CAPACITY AT MANY CABLE SYSTEMS
 ALSO CABLE OPERATORS ARE ALREADY SIGNING UP FOR ANOTHER PROPOSED NEW CABLE NETWORK TURNER BROADCASTING SYSTEM INCORPORATED'S T. N. T. SCHEDULED FOR AN OCTOBER THIRD LAUNCH
 THE CHANGES ALSO WILL LEVY A NEW THREE PERCENT VALUE ADDED TAX THROUGH WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HOPES TO RAISE FIVE POINT OH TRILLION TO FIVE POINT FOUR TRILLION YEN
 A VALUE ADDED TAX IS IMPOSED ON THE ADDED VALUE AT EACH STAGE OF A PRODUCT'S PROGRESS FROM RAW MATERIALS TO CONSUMPTION
 CAPITAL GAINS ON STOCK AND BOND TRANSACTIONS ALSO WILL BE NEWLY TAXED UNDER THE PLAN
 THE LONG TERM CASELOAD REDUCTIONS DO NOT RESULT FROM PUSHING FREELOADERS OFF THE WELFARE ROLLS
 IN OHIO RELATIVELY FEW RECIPIENTS WERE SANCTIONED FOR REFUSING TO WORK
 EVEN WHEN SANCTIONED RECIPIENTS MAY STAY ON WELFARE ROLLS ALBEIT AT LOWER BENEFIT LEVELS
 THUS FORCED WELFARE EXITS ARE RARE
 MOREOVER THE NUMBER OF WELFARE APPLICATIONS DID NOT DIMINISH AFTER WORKFARE REQUIREMENTS WERE IMPOSED
 THUS MANDATORY WORK REQUIREMENTS DID NOT ACT AS A DETERRENT TO WELFARE AS MANY OF ITS STRONGEST ADHERENTS BELIEVED IT WOULD
 BUT THE INTERNAL DISAGREEMENTS AND THE ARGUMENTS AT LUNCH HERE ARE ONLY PART OF THE AGONIES OF SUCH ACTIVISTS
 SOMETIMES ACCOMMODATION THOUGH PAINFUL IS NECESSARY
 A LONGTIME SUPPORTER OF THE REVEREND JESSE JACKSON AND POLITICAL OPPONENT OF PRESIDENT REAGAN MS. MYERS FELT THE STRAIN LAST NOVEMBER
 BUT WITH A CHOICE TO MAKE SHE VOTED FOR GEORGE BUSH
 I'VE BECOME A SINGLE ISSUE VOTER SHE SAYS
 NONFARM PRODUCTIVITY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER AFTER PLUNGING ONE POINT THREE PERCENT IN THE FIRST
 THE REPORT ALSO OFFERED EVIDENCE THAT INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ARE EBBING ALTHOUGH THEY ARE STILL CONSIDERABLE
 UNIT LABOR COSTS ROSE AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT TWO PERCENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER TRAILING THE SIX POINT TWO PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE FIRST
