MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER 
IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS 
THAT WOULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES 
BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY

BURNUP AND SIMS HAS INTERESTS IN TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND SOFT DRINKS AMONG OTHER THINGS 
MR. POSNER BEGAN INVESTING IN IT IN THE EARLY NINETEEN SEVENTIES AND BY THE EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTIES CONTROLLED MORE THAN FORTY PERCENT OF ITS SHARES 
BUT BURNUP AND SIMS MANAGEMENT WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND AT ONE POINT EIGHTEEN TOP BURNUP AND SIMS QUIT IN PROTEST

UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL 
THE APPARENT INCONSISTENCY IS JUSTIFIED MAINTAINED ROBERT BURGER CHEVROLET GENERAL MANAGER GIVEN THE GROWING DIFFICULTY IN LAUNCHING MODELS IN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE FIELD

CHEVROLET IS USING THE SAME APPROACH WITH ITS GEO LINE OF IMPORT CARS THAT DEBUTS THIS FALL 
OFFICIALS OF BOTH SAUDI ARABIA AND TEXACO NOTED THE KINGDOM AND THE COMPANY HAVE HAD AN ASSOCIATION OF MORE THAN FIFTY YEARS IN THE PRODUCTION OF PETROLEUM 
AND THEIR JOINT VENTURE REPRESENTS BY FAR THE BIGGEST MOVE YET INTO REFINING AND MARKETING BY A MEMBER OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES 
THE JOINT VENTURE WILL RANK TENTH IN TOTAL GASOLINE SALES IN THE U. S. 
BECAUSE THE AUTO INDUSTRY'S GOOD TIMES ROLLED ON SO LONG EACH COMPANY ASSUMED THAT WHEN THE CRUNCH CAME THE OTHER GUY WOULD GET HURT 
THAT WAS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF HONDA

THE FINANCIAL ENTREPRENEUR IS A SOPHISTICATED PARTICIPANT IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS USING ITS RESOURCES TO HIS ADVANTAGE 
IF HE IS A RAIDER MOST OFTEN HE IS INTERESTED IN THE ARBITRAGE BETWEEN THE ACQUISITION VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE AND THE ULTIMATE VALUE OF ITS PARTS 
THE LEVERAGED BUYOUT ARTIST ON THE OTHER HAND IS MOST OFTEN A PARTNER WITH MANAGEMENT IN ACQUIRING AND OPERATING THE ENTERPRISE 
HE MAY FINANCE THE ACQUISITION WITH JUNK BONDS OR HE MAY DO IT PRIVATELY WITH LEADING INSURANCE COMPANIES AND COMMERCIAL BANKS

THE RULING IS A SIGNIFICANT VICTORY FOR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AFTER A MAJOR SETBACK ON THE USE OF GRAND JURY MATERIALS IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE SUPREME COURT RULING 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE THE HIGH COURT RULED THAT LAWYERS HANDLING CIVIL CASES IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT NEEDED A COURT ORDER TO GAIN ACCESS TO SECRET GRAND JURY EVIDENCE 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS COMPLAINED THAT THE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE RULING HAMPERED THEIR INVESTIGATIVE EFFORTS 
THESE CRITICISMS ARE OVERWROUGHT AND UNCONVINCING 
WHILE PRIVATE OPERATORS WILL CERTAINLY LOBBY IN THEIR OWN INTEREST IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT THEY COULD MANIPULATE PUBLIC OPINION AND LAWMAKERS AS EASILY AS THEIR OPPONENTS SUGGEST 
NOR IS IT CLEAR THAT PRIVATE PRISON OPERATORS WOULD HAVE TO LOBBY FOR HARSHER SENTENCES 
GIVEN CURRENT LEVELS OF OVERCROWDING AND PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF STRICTER SENTENCING THERE WILL BE NO SHORTAGE OF INMATES TO FILL THE NEW FACILITIES 
THE DECISION HAS CONSIDERABLE IMMEDIATE PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE 
MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER APPEALS RAISING THE ARBITRATION ISSUE HAVE BEEN FILED WITH THE SUPREME COURT

THE CALL IS LIKELY TO PROMPT HOLDERS TO CONVERT THE SHARES INTO COMMON RATHER THAN HAVE THEM REDEEMED 
EACH DEPOSITARY SHARE CAN BE CONVERTED INTO ONE AND TWO THIRDS COMMON

IN BOTH THE HUNGARIAN AND SUEZ CRISES THE UNITED STATES PROCEEDED IN ACCORD WITH THE RULE OF AVOIDING DIRECT CONFRONTATION WITH THE SOVIET UNION 
IN THE HUNGARIAN AFFAIR THIS MEANT DOING NOTHING EXCEPT TALKING BECAUSE TAKING ANY PRACTICAL STEP WOULD AT ONCE HAVE MEANT A CONFRONTATION 
IN THE SUEZ AFFAIR THE AVOIDANCE OF CONFRONTATION WENT ALL THE WAY TO COLLABORATION 
ALSO PROVIDING SOME SOLACE FOR MUNICIPAL BOND PROFESSIONALS IS THE FACT THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE BECOMING MORE ACTIVE AS UNDERWRITERS RATHER THAN AS INVESTORS 
THIS MEANS THEY WILL NEED TO HIRE MORE INVESTMENT BANKERS 
THE BANKS' MOVE IS PART OF THEIR EFFORT TO TEST AND EXPAND THE LIMITS OF SECURITIES AND BANKING LAWS 
A ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR ISSUE OF HOUSEHOLD FINANCE CORPORATION SEVEN YEAR NOTES WAS OFFERED THROUGH UNDERWRITERS LED BY MERRILL LYNCH CAPITAL MARKETS 
THE TEN PERCENT NOTES WERE PRICED AT PAR AND THE RETURN IS ZERO POINT SEVEN TWO OF A PERCENTAGE POINT ABOVE THE RATE ON COMPARABLE TREASURY NOTES

FLOATING FAILS WHEN GOVERNMENTS TRY TO ESCAPE FROM THE VERDICT OF THE EXCHANGE MARKETS ON THEIR POLICIES BY RESORTING TO DIRECT CONTROLS OVER TRADE AND CAPITAL FLOWS 
BECAUSE THIS LATTER THREAT IS NOW SO SEVERE THE WORLD IS RIGHT TO TALK ABOUT INTERNATIONAL MONETARY REFORM IF ONLY AS A DELAYING GAME 
BUT IDEALISTIC TALK SHOULD NOT DECEIVE STABILIZING EXCHANGE RATES REQUIRES DEPENDENCE AND SUBORDINATION NOT THE FREEDOM FOR EVERYBODY TO DO THEIR OWN THING 
ONLY ONCE IN THIS COLLECTION DOES SOMEONE OR SOMETHING GO CLEARLY FROM POINT A TO POINT B. RIGHT IN FRONT OF US 
THE STORY GETTING INTO THE SET THOUGH COMIC IN TONE IS ABOUT A WOMAN SELLING HER SOUL FOR THE WORLD 
IT IS HILARIOUS AND PAINFUL ESPECIALLY THE KICKER AT THE END AND IT IS THE ONLY STORY HERE THAT DOES NOT READ LIKE NEWS FROM THE NEXT COUNTY 
IT'S WORTHY NOTING THAT ONE REASON THE GOVERNMENT GETS SO INVOLVED IN ZONING IS TO FIX PROBLEMS CREATED BY OTHER REGULATIONS 
RENT CONTROL REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF LOW COST HOUSING AND EVEN IN PLACES SUCH AS NEW YORK CITY PRICES EVEN MIDDLE CLASS RENTERS OUT OF THE MARKET 
BUT TWO WRONGS DO NOT MAKE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT 
NEXT TERM THE SUPREME COURT WILL RULE ON A SAN JOSE RENT CONTROL LAW THAT FORCES LANDLORDS TO CHARGE LESS RENT TO LOWER INCOME TENANTS

MR. TANAKA WAS ONE OF THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER

THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES

ANOTHER POTENTIAL POINT OF CONTENTION IS THE E. C.'S PLAN TO ALLOW THE FREE FLOW OF PEOPLE ACROSS BORDERS 
SWITZERLAND ALREADY HAS ATTRACTED ONE MILLION RESIDENT ALIENS A PORTION OF ITS POPULATION GREATER THAN IN ANY E. C. STATE EXCEPT LUXEMBOURG

FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS 
THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR 
!NOISE IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER 
SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE

WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS 
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT

CREDIT CARD BORROWING SOARED BY TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS OR AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF NINETEEN POINT FOUR PERCENT

CHEMICAL'S TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES INCORPORATED UNIT REPORTED PROFIT OF SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS 
THAT FIGURE INCLUDES A THIRTEEN MILLION DOLLAR GAIN FROM INTERCOMPANY INCOME TAX BENEFITS UNDER THE CORPORATION'S TAX SHARING AGREEMENT 
IN THE YEAR AGO QUARTER TEXAS COMMERCE HAD A LOSS OF THIRTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS WHICH INCLUDED A SPECIAL CHARGE FROM THE RESTRUCTURING

I DON'T KNOW IF THE PARENTS UNDERSTAND HOW SUBTLE THIS NEW AGE MOVEMENT REALLY IS SHE SAYS 
THEY DRAW THE KIDS IN WITH FAIRY TALES AND SORCERY 
THEIR ULTIMATE GOAL IS TO DO AWAY WITH ANYBODY WHO BELIEVES THERE'S SUCH A THING AS EVIL 
THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER 
THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES 
BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM 
ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS 
IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE 
SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON 
MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS 
SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY 
SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA 
SOME OF THAT CASH HAS BEEN USED FOR BONUS PAYMENTS 
WAGES AND BONUSES ROSE NINETEEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST HALF A RATE THAT FAR OUTPACED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND EXERTED UPWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES 
CHINA'S ECONOMY GREW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF FIVE POINT SEVEN PERCENT IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS ROUGHLY HALF THE AVERAGE ANNUAL RATE IN THE PAST DECADE

TEXAS OF COURSE IS WHERE THE MOST TROUBLE IS TO BE FOUND 
LENDERS THERE LIKE TO BLAME THE SO CALLED OIL PATCH RECESSION 
BUT THE PROBLEM IN FACT IS BAD BANKING IN A FEW CASES EVEN CORRUPT BANKING 
SOME PARTS OF TEXAS THE DALLAS FORT 
WORTH AREA FOR EXAMPLE HAVEN'T HAD ANYTHING THAT LEGITIMATELY COULD BE CALLED A RECESSION 
THE MAIN REASON SO MANY LENDERS ARE IN TROUBLE IS AN OLD FASHIONED FAILING AMONG BANKERS A WEAKNESS FOR REAL ESTATE SPECULATION

WASHINGTON BELIEVES THAT JAPAN PROFITS FROM FREE U. S. MARKETS AND SHOULD RECIPROCATE WITH COMPLETELY FREE JAPANESE MARKET 
TOKYO GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS CLAIM TO FAVOR FREE MARKETS IN PRACTICE THEY OFTEN ARE LOATH TO RELINQUISH COMPLETE CONTROL ESPECIALLY IN PROMISING INDUSTRIES 
THE RICHMOND VIRGINIA MEDIA CONCERN SAID SALES AND PROFITS FROM ITS NEWSPRINT OPERATIONS WERE AHEAD OF YEAR EARLIER LEVELS 
ITS CABLE SYSTEM CONTINUED TO GAIN SUBSCRIBERS NOW TOTALING MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND

IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT 
I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE 
I NOW CONFESS MY ERROR AND EMBRACE LEADER BUSH'S PERCEPTION THAT THE A. C. L. U. IS A POLITICALLY SUSPECT LIBERAL CONSPIRACY

THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSE THIS HIGH PRESSURE 
THE DEPARTMENT ALSO SAID THAT PRODUCTIVITY FOR NONFINANCIAL COMPANIES INCREASED AT A ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT ANNUAL RATE IN THE THIRD QUARTER A PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE 
THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON AN INCREASE IN OUTPUT OF ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT AND AN INCREASE IN HOURS WORKED OF ONE POINT ONE PERCENT 
THIS WAS THE FIRST QUARTER IN WHICH PRODUCTIVITY INCREASED IN THE NONFINANCIAL SECTOR SINCE THE THIRD QUARTER OF NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
ANALYSTS SAID THE ECONOMY APPEARS EVEN WEAKER SO FAR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 
THE ECONOMICS MINISTRY YESTERDAY SAID THE INFLOW OF ORDERS TO MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY FELL A PRELIMINARY TWO PERCENT IN OCTOBER FROM SEPTEMBER 
THAT FOLLOWED NEWS EARLIER IN THE WEEK THAT INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION WAS STAGNANT IN OCTOBER 
SO FAR ILLEGAL FOREIGN WORKERS AREN'T TAKEN AS A JOB THREAT BY JAPANESE WORKERS 
BUT JAPANESE UNEMPLOYMENT IS AT HISTORICALLY HIGH LEVELS BECAUSE OF THE YEN'S STRENGTH POSING A KNOTTY PROBLEM FOR THE GOVERNMENT

THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE 
ETHICS CONSULTANTS ON THE OTHER HAND SHOULD BE CLINICIANS AND TEACH DECISION MAKING SKILLS TO PRACTICING PHYSICIANS WHEN DOING CASE CONSULTATION 
COMPETENCY IN MEDICINE AND TRAINING IN ETHICS ARE REQUIRED TO SOLVE MORAL PROBLEMS IN PATIENT CARE 
EVEN MORE IMPORTANT HOWEVER IS THE INDIVIDUAL CONSULTANT'S ABILITY TO TEACH PRACTITIONERS TO FORM THEIR OWN CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVING ETHICAL PROBLEMS 
WHEN SEEKING TO MAKE THE FAIREST AND MOST ETHICAL DECISIONS LET'S GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT AT THE PATIENT'S BEDSIDE NOT IN A COMMITTEE ROOM 
THE PROBLEM ACCORDING TO VENTURE CAPITALISTS WHO READ HUNDREDS OF BUSINESS PLANS EACH YEAR IS THAT MOST ENTREPRENEURS GET THEIR PRIORITIES REVERSED 
IN THEIR RUSH TO GET THE NEW IDEA LAUNCHED THEY DON'T SPEND ENOUGH TIME PREPARING THEIR BUSINESS PLAN 
THEN THEY EXPECT A POTENTIAL PARTNER OR LENDER TO SPEND THREE HOURS READING IT 
IN ADDITION BY CONSENTING TO RORER'S BID ROBINS MAY HAVE PUT ITSELF UP FOR SALE 
THE WHOLE THING COULD STILL DETERIORATE INTO AN AUCTION SAID A LAWYER WHO WAS INVOLVED IN THE MANVILLE CORPORATION BANKRUPTCY LAW CASE 
OTHER BIDDERS COULD COME IN 
HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS 
THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE 
THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS 
OF HIS COMPANY'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN OPERATING EXPENSES LAST YEAR FULLY HALF WENT FOR MARKETING 
THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO NEGOTIATION OF AN AGREEMENT AND THE APPROVAL OF TRI STAR DIRECTORS SHAREHOLDERS AND COCA COLA DIRECTORS 
IT ALSO WOULD HAVE TO SATISFY VARIOUS REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS 
COCA COLA SAID IT HOPES TO COMPLETE THE TRANSACTION BY THE END OF THIS YEAR 
BECAUSE OF COCA COLA'S SIZABLE STAKE IN TRI STAR THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO BE CARRIED OUT 
THE ADDED INVESTMENT COMES AT A TIME OF CONTINUING RED INK AT THE TELEVISION VENTURE AND AMID WIDESPREAD SPECULATION THAT NEWS CORPORATION WAS PLANNING TO REDUCE ITS INVESTMENT 
IN THE YEAR ENDED JUNE THIRTIETH SATELLITE TELEVISION POSTED A PRETAX LOSS OF FIVE POINT SIX NINE MILLION POUNDS ON REVENUE OF EIGHT MILLION POUNDS THE SPOKESWOMAN SAID 
IT STILL IS POSSIBLE THAT NEWS INTERNATIONAL MAY CUT ITS STAKE SHE SAID 
IT IS CONCEIVABLE AT SOME POINT THAT THE THING COULD BEGIN TO MUSHROOM HE SAID 
IF THAT HAPPENS THEN WHAT HAS GOT TO BE DONE TO PRESERVE THE ECONOMY AND PREVENT IT FROM BREAKING APART IS DANGEROUSLY HIGH INTEREST RATES 
IT WOULD CAUSE A TREMENDOUS CONTRACTION IN THE ECONOMY 
THE PROGRAM APPLIES TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER SECOND 
THE ELIGIBLE SHAREHOLDERS MAY OWN FEWER THAN ONE HUNDRED SHARES IN ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANIES 
MERRILL LYNCH SAID IT WILL RESELL THE SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET 
NONETHELESS THE TALKS WERE MARKED BY AN EASING OF TRADE TENSIONS IN CONTRAST WITH THE COURSE OF RELATIONS IN PREVIOUS YEARS 
U. S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE CLAYTON YEUTTER SAID THE TWO SIDES WERE HANDLING TRADE RELATIONS AS WELL AS AT ANY OTHER TIME IN RECENT MEMORY 
BUT HE WARNED OF ADDITIONAL CONFRONTATION IF NO PROGRESS WAS MADE ON FARM ISSUES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT BURNER 
NOTHING HAS BEEN DECIDED

AS A RESULT THE GOVERNMENT IS TALKING OF HIGHER FARM PRICES 
BUT HIGHER FARM PRICES WOULD ADD TO AN ALREADY STEEP INFLATION RATE 
SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS

A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE

ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS 
REGULATORS IN STATES THAT HAD ALLOWED TARGETED MAILINGS BEFORE THE COURT'S RULING SAY COMPLAINTS HAVE BEEN RARE

LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA 
THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING

THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE HERE SAYS BOND ANALYST DANIEL SCOTTO OF L. F. ROTHSCHILD UNTERBERG AND TOWBIN 
WE ARE ALL CONCERNED THAT THE REGULATORS CAN SIT BACK AND WAIT FOR CREDIT TO CARRY THE COMPANY OUT INTO THE HORIZON 
BUT HE ADDED THE BANKERS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE REGULATORS AND THE REGULATORS ARE WAITING FOR COMMITMENTS FROM THE BANKERS 
THE ACCORD MOST LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE SOME PRIVATE AGREEMENT AMONG MINISTERS ON HOW FAR UP OR DOWN THESE RATES CAN MOVE AND STILL BE ACCEPTABLE 
BUT OFFICIALS SAID IT IS UNLIKELY THESE LIMITS WOULD BE MADE PUBLIC 
AND IT ISN'T KNOWN YET WHETHER THE MAJOR POWERS WOULD PLEDGE TO INTERVENE IN CURRENCY MARKETS IF EXCHANGE RATES WERE TO EXCEED THOSE LIMITS 
THE REMAINING OFFSETTING COLLECTIONS OF MORE THAN THREE BILLION DOLLARS COME FROM USER FEES WHICH ALSO CLEARLY ARE NOT TAXES 
A USER FEE IS A SPECIFIC CHARGE FOR A DIRECT BENEFIT RECEIVED 
LIKE AN ASSET SALE BUT UNLIKE A TAX A USER FEE DOES NOT INVOLVE COMPULSION 
ONE CHARACTERISTIC OF USER FEES IS THAT THEY REVEAL HOW MUCH GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS ARE REALLY WORTH TO DIRECT RECIPIENTS IN THE MOST DIRECT AND MEANINGFUL WAY POSSIBLE 
ONE OF THE STRONGEST ARGUMENTS THAT A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS WORTHWHILE OCCURS WHEN IT HAS A USER FEE AND THE FEE COVERS COSTS 
THE REVERSE IS ALSO TRUE AND THAT IS ONE REASON SOME BENEFICIARIES OPPOSE USER FEES

HELENE CURTIS BILLS ABOUT TEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS EQUAL TO ABOUT HALF OF CARTER WALLACE'S BILLINGS ACCORDING TO INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES 
DURABLE GOODS ORDERS ROSE ONE POINT FOUR PERCENT IN JUNE BUT THE GAIN CAME ENTIRELY FROM MILITARY ITEMS 
THE REPORT WAS CONSIDERED A FURTHER SIGN THAT THE ECONOMY REMAINS WEAK

U. S. INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THE TERRORISTS IS CONSIDERED POOR 
IT HAS PROVEN DIFFICULT TO INFILTRATE SMALL TERRORIST CELLS WHICH OFTEN ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS

THE VOLKSWAGEN FOX SUBCOMPACT WAS ORIGINALLY BROUGHT TO THE U. S. FROM BRAZIL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX AS V. W.'S LATEST ATTEMPT TO MARKET AN ENTRY LEVEL CAR 
BUT RAMPANT BRAZILIAN INFLATION SENT FOX PRICES SOARING AND VOLKSWAGEN FAILED TO OFFER AN OPTIONAL AUTOMATIC TRANSMISSION 
THE EXISTING BENCHMARK THIRTY YEAR BONDS ENDED ONE AND THREE EIGHTHS LOWER OR DOWN THIRTEEN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT

THE PRICE ON THE LONG TERM BOND WAS QUOTED AT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SEVEN AND THIRTY THIRTY SECONDS 
THE NEW TEN YEAR NOTES WERE QUOTED IN WHEN ISSUED TRADING AT ABOUT NINETY NINE AND FOURTEEN THIRTY SECONDS TO YIELD EIGHT POINT OH SIX FIVE PERCENT 
THE OFFICIAL ACKNOWLEDGED BUSINESS COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE FREQUENCY OF GOVERNMENT CHANGES IN THE TAX LAW BUT HE DISMISSED THEM

HE ADDED THAT EVERYONE MANAGEMENT BILL SPOOR AND THE BOARD APPROVED THE RESULTING PLAN 
IT WAS THE RETURN LAST SEPTEMBER OF WILLIAM H. SPOOR PILLSBURY'S FORMER CHAIRMAN THAT TRIGGERED SPECULATION OF MAJOR CHANGES AT THE COMPANY HE HAD RESHAPED AND GROWN 
THE PENTAGON PROPOSED INCREASING OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE ACCOUNTS BY TWO POINT FOUR PERCENT IN THE COMING FISCAL YEAR 
THESE PAY FOR TRAINING SHIP STEAMING HOURS AND THE COSTS OF KEEPING WEAPONS IN GOOD REPAIR 
MR. CARLUCCI EMPHASIZED THAT IT IS PREFERABLE TO KEEP A SMALLER FORCE THAT IS ADEQUATELY PAID AND READY TO FIGHT THAN TO HAVE A LARGER FORCE THAT ISN'T 
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER IF WE REPEAT THE EXPERIENCE OF THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHERE YOU KEEP THE FRAMEWORK BUT HOLLOW IT OUT HE SAID

SUPPORTERS OF THE EXPORT EFFORT BELIEVE THAT IT IS A VITAL PART OF NURTURING THE COUNTRY'S DOMESTIC INDUSTRY 
A RELATIVELY SMALL LOCAL MARKET OF SIXTEEN MILLION CONSUMERS MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR COMPANIES TO RECOUP RECORDING COSTS UNLESS RECORDS SELL OVERSEAS 
FURTHERMORE A HEFTY SALES TAX ON RECORDS AND TAPES KEEPS DOMESTIC SALES DOWN THE EXPORT PROMOTERS SAY

THE JURY'S STILL OUT ON WHETHER THESE TECHNIQUES WILL PROVE USEFUL SAYS JOHN N. BELL WHO MANAGES THE FUND 
BUT THEY'RE PROMISING ENOUGH THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO GIVE THEM A PORTION OF THEIR ASSETS 
THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY 
SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES 
THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION 
MOST OF BOZELL'S REVLON RELATED REVENUE LAST YEAR CAME FROM MEDIA PLACEMENTS 
BOZELL IS SAID TO HAVE PLACED ABOUT FORTY MILLION DOLLARS OF ADS FOR REVLON LAST YEAR

GRAINS AND SOYBEANS THE THREAT OF RAIN AND FAVORABLE SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS PUSHED SOYBEAN AND CORN FUTURES PRICES LOWER 
THE LATEST WEATHER FORECAST CALLS FOR FAIRLY GOOD MOISTURE IN MIDWEST FARMING STATES OVER THE NEXT SIX TO TEN DAYS 
ANALYSTS SAID TRADERS ARE SHIFTING THEIR EMPHASIS AWAY FROM LAST YEAR'S CROP AND TO THIS YEAR'S 
WITH THIS YEAR'S SMALL ACREAGE INCREASES WEATHER AND SPRING PLANTING CONDITIONS ARE MAJOR CONCERNS TO A MARKET THAT IS BEGINNING TO SHAKE OFF A HUGE SURPLUS 
THE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS HELPED THE SOYBEAN CONTRACT FOR NOVEMBER SETTLEMENT CLOSE AT SIX POINT EIGHT TWO TWO FIVE DOLLARS A BUSHEL DOWN NINE POINT FIVE CENTS

THE PHILIPPINES IS OF COURSE A TOUGH COUNTRY TO GOVERN 
IT REFLECTS CREDIT ON MRS. AQUINO THAT SHE HAS STUCK TO HER DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES THROUGH FIVE COUP ATTEMPTS AS WELL AS NONSTOP POLITICAL DOGFIGHTS 
MRS. AQUINO UNDERSTANDS CORRECTLY THAT AS THE ELECTED PRESIDENT SHE IS ABOVE SUCH NONSENSE 
HER RESPONSIBILITY IS TO THE VOTERS WHO RECOGNIZED THE NATION'S DESPERATE NEED FOR REFORM AND GAVE HER THEIR MANDATE 
TO AVOID MORE OUTBURSTS SUCH AS MR. LAUREL'S IT'S TIME THAT MRS. AQUINO STARTED USING THAT MANDATE 
PRICES GRADUALLY MOVED HIGHER THROUGH MIDAFTERNOON WHEN THE MARKET PEAKED AND THEN STARTED ITS RETREAT 
PHILIP PUCCIO MANAGER OF INSTITUTIONAL TRADING AT DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID SOME INSTITUTIONS USED THE ADVANCE AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOME SELLING 
THEY'VE BEEN PEELING OFF SOME STOCK TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BETTER PRICES HE SAID 
THIS YEAR CHALLENGERS HAD A CHANCE OF WINNING ONLY IF THE INCUMBENT WAS BRUSHED BY SCANDAL 
OF THE SIX MEMBERS WHO APPARENTLY LOST ALL BUT TWO CONTENDED WITH MISCONDUCT CHARGES 
AN INCREDIBLE EIGHTY TWO PERCENT OF HOUSE RACES WERE DECIDED THIS YEAR BY LANDSLIDES MARGINS OF AT LEAST SIXTY TO FORTY

THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE 
BUT JOHN SMALE P. AND G.'S CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE USED THE MEETING TO SPEAK AT LENGTH ABOUT HOSTILE TAKEOVERS IN GENERAL 
HE MAINTAINED THAT TOO OFTEN THEY LEAVE COMPANIES LOADED WITH DEBT AND SHRUNKEN RESEARCH BUDGETS AND IGNORE THE INTERESTS OF EMPLOYEES AND THE COMMUNITIES IN WHICH THE COMPANIES DO BUSINESS 
HE ALSO ARGUED THAT OVER THE LONG RUN HOSTILE TAKEOVERS DON'T NECESSARILY PROVIDE A GOOD MECHANISM FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO REALIZE FULL VALUE FOR THEIR SHARE 
FOR THE WALL STREET FIRMS THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS COULD COME MONDAY WHEN SHARES AND CASH OF LAST MONDAY'S TRADES ARE ACTUALLY SUPPOSED TO CHANGE HANDS 
ALREADY THE LEVEL OF TRADES IN WHICH THE TERMS ARE IN DISPUTE IS RUNNING AT A RELATIVELY HIGH LEVEL SAID MR. <UNK>

DEALERS SAID ACTIVITY WAS SLOW BECAUSE OF THE U. S. HOLIDAY CELEBRATING THE BIRTHDAY OF MARTIN LUTHER KING JUNIOR 
MOST U. S. BANKS WERE CLOSED ALTHOUGH SEVERAL OF THE LARGER FOREIGN EXCHANGE DEPARTMENTS REMAINED OPEN TO SERVICE CORPORATE AND INSTITUTIONAL CUSTOMERS AND TRADE WITH EUROPE 
BUT EVEN THEY WOUND DOWN THEIR TRADING WHEN THE LONDON MARKET SHUT DOWN AROUND NOON E. S. T. OR AFTER THE CHICAGO FUTURES MARKET CLOSED LATER IN THE AFTERNOON 
MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT 
MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS 
THE JANUARY INCREASE FOLLOWED A REVISED DECEMBER EXPANSION OF THREE POINT NINE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS FOUR POINT FOUR FIVE BILLION DOLLARS 
AUTO LOANS OUTSTANDING INCREASED ONE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN JANUARY AFTER AN INCREASE OF TWO POINT THREE TWO BILLION DOLLARS THE PREVIOUS MONTH 
POINTING TO THE STRONG CAR SALES REPORTED FOR LATE FEBRUARY SEVERAL ECONOMISTS SUGGESTED THE MEASURE WILL AGAIN SHOW AN INCREASE IN THE REPORT RELEASED NEXT MONTH 
THIS WARNING ALSO CARRIES A DEEPER WARNING TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH 
WHY DID PRESIDENT REAGAN SIGN THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION WITHOUT READING IT 
WHY DID THE F. C. C. THEN GO TO COURT TO DEFEND THE KENNEDY PROVISION WHEN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH KNEW IT WAS OUTRAGEOUS 
IN OTHER WORDS WHY DID IT FALL TO THE COURTS TO PROTECT THE PREROGATIVES OF THE PRESIDENCY 
THE SUIT WAS FILED LAST MONTH ONLY TWO DAYS AFTER A SENATE BANKING COMMITTEE HEARING ON DUAL STOCK CLASSES HELD BY SENATORS 
RICHARD C. SHELBY D. ALABAMA AND WILLIAM ARMSTRONG R. COLORADO OPPONENTS OF THE TWO TIER STOCKS

FOR GILLETTE SHAREHOLDERS THE FIGHT REPRESENTS A CLASSIC CASE OF SHORT TERM VERSUS LONG TERM INTERESTS

WHEN WE CALL ON RETAILERS AND TRY TO GET A NEW PRODUCT ON THE SHELF WE DO LEVERAGE OUR ASSOCIATION WITH COLGATE MR. SPELLING SAYS 
THE COMPANY SAID LIFE INSURANCE AND PROPERTY AND CASUALTY INSURANCE OPERATIONS HAD RECORD FIRST QUARTER RESULTS 
IT SAID THAT FINANCE UNIT EARNINGS ROSE FORTY ONE PERCENT AND THAT ITS LEASING UNIT HAD RECORD RESULTS BECAUSE OF HIGH UTILIZATION RATES 
CONSUMER LENDING ALONG WITH TAX AND TITLE OPERATIONS DECLINED REFLECTING LAGGING BUT NOW IMPROVING REAL ESTATE SALES THE COMPANY SAID 
THE GOVERNMENT'S OFFICIAL ARMED FORCES MAGAZINES TRADITIONALLY HAVE BEEN OFF LIMITS TO ALL ADVERTISERS

THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE

WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY 
SHULTZ SAID TALKS INTENDED TO INDUCE THE MILITARY LEADER TO LEAVE PANAMA HAD COLLAPSED BECAUSE NORIEGA WOULDN'T CARRY THROUGH WITH THE OFFER WORKED OUT BY HIS NEGOTIATORS 
THE SECRETARY OF STATE SAID THAT FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WEREN'T PLANNED AND THAT NO OFFERS REMAIN ON THE TABLE

MR. BUSH NEVER WAS STRONGLY IDENTIFIED WITH THE SOCIAL CONSERVATIVE WING OF THE PARTY 
MR. REAGAN HIMSELF WHEN HE GOT IN OFFICE PUT ITS ISSUES ON THE BACK BURNER 
THE TOTAL CUT WOULD CORRESPOND TO THE AMOUNT OF COFFEE SOLD AND NOT EXCEED EIGHTEEN THOUSAND BAGS 
ONE BAG EQUALS SIXTY KILOS 
THE ANNUAL GLOBAL EXPORT QUOTA IS FIFTY FOUR POINT FIVE MILLION <UNK> 
THIS LACK OF UNDERSTANDING HAS INVESTORS LICKING THEIR CHOPS ON TWO <UNK> 
ONE CAMP THINKS THAT THE STOCK HAS REMAINED UNDERVALUED AS INVESTORS GRAPPLE TO COMPREHEND THE BUSINESSES 
ANOTHER CAMP HOPES FOR A TAKEOVER OR LEVERAGED BUYOUT THOUGH THE ERIE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW OF ANY SUCH THING IN THE WORKS 
MARKET PARTICIPANTS ARE UNCERTAIN WHETHER A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION WOULD IMPOSE A BAN ON SOME OF THE METALS HE SAYS 
IT IS ALSO FEASIBLE THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN GOVERNMENT WOULD RETALIATE SELECTIVELY HE SAYS 
IT COULD REDUCE SUPPLIES OF VITAL METALS THAT ACCOUNT FOR ONLY A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE NATION'S EXPORTS MR. PRAGER SAYS 
HOWEVER HE LEAVES PRIME AT A DIFFICULT TIME 
THE COMPUTER MARKET IS GROWING SLOWLY AND PRIME'S PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS ARE LOSING GROUND TO INDUSTRY STANDARD COMPUTERS THAT USE THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM 
AND SOME WALL STREET ANALYSTS THINK PRIME SHOULD HAVE CUT COSTS MORE RAPIDLY IN THE WAKE OF THE COMPUTERVISION ACQUISITION 
N. B. C.'S T. V. COVERAGE ALSO GETS ITS SHARE OF THE BLAME 
MARKETERS SAY IT WAS SO BLAND AND SKIPPED SO FREQUENTLY FROM ONE EVENT TO ANOTHER THAT THERE WAS LITTLE CHANCE FOR EXCITEMENT TO BUILD 
THE CONSTANT COMMERCIAL INTERRUPTIONS WHICH LED TO RATINGS THAT WERE MUCH LOWER THAN EXPECTED DIDN'T HELP EITHER 
NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT 
CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP 
THERE MAY BE GROWING JAPANESE SELF CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW JAPANESE ENTREPRENEURS 
THERE MAY BE SCADS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL 
THERE ARE STILL LEGISLATIVE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED ON THE SENATE FLOOR AND AMONG FOUR HOUSE COMMITTEES BEFORE THE BILL REACHES THE HOUSE FLOOR 
BUSINESS GROUPS FOR EXAMPLE ARE UNHAPPY AT PROVISIONS REQUIRING BUS COMPANIES TO INSTALL WHEELCHAIR LIFTS AND HANDICAPPED TOILETS IN NEW OVER THE ROAD BUSES 
THE GROUPS ALSO CRITICIZE THE LACK OF A BLANKET SMALL BUSINESS EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC <UNK> 
BUT MANY OTHER BUSINESS OBJECTIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN DEALT WITH IN THE WHITE HOUSE SENATE NEGOTIATIONS PRETTY MUCH ELIMINATING THE CHANCES THAT THE MEASURE COULD YET BE DERAILED 
STILL INVESTORS POURED ONE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS MORE INTO STOCK FUNDS IN JULY THAN THEY TOOK OUT THE HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE LAST DECEMBER 
THAT SURPASSED THE ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR NET INFLOW IN JUNE AND MARKED A TURNAROUND FROM A THREE HUNDRED FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLAR OUTFLOW IN JULY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT

THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES

AIRLINES SAY AIRSPACE HAS BECOME SO CROWDED IN EUROPE THAT ANY AIRLINE MISSING AN ASSIGNED TAKEOFF SLOT MAY HAVE TO WAIT AN HOUR FOR ANOTHER FREE SLOT

I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK YOU FOR RUNNING ALEXANDER <UNK> VIEWPOINT COLUMN 
HIS COLUMNS OFTEN PROVIDE A FRESH SLANT ON THE MAJOR ISSUES OF THE DAY 
HIS IDEAS ARE OFTEN CONTRARY TO POPULAR OPINION BUT THEY PROVIDE NEW IDEAS TO BROADEN THE READER'S OWN PERSPECTIVE 
TAKEOVER TALK AROUSED INTEREST IN TWO FINANCIAL CONCERNS 
MERCANTILE BANCORP SOARED FIVE AND ONE HALF TO THIRTY AND THREE QUARTERS ON RENEWED BUYOUT SPECULATION 
SUN STATE SAVINGS AND LOAN ENDED AT EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER UP TWO AFTER CONFIRMING THAT IT RECEIVED AN UNSOLICITED ACQUISITION PROPOSAL FROM AN INVESTMENT GROUP 
ONE SIMPLE MOTIVATION IS BEHIND THE NETWORKS' PUMPED UP MARKETING EFFORTS DESPERATION 
COMPANIES THAT ONCE HAD TO ADVERTISE ON THE NETWORKS IF THEY WANTED TO REACH A MASS AUDIENCE NOW CAN CHOOSE INSTEAD FROM A HOST OF CABLE AND INDEPENDENT STATIONS 
AT THE SAME TIME MARKETERS HAVE PULLED MONEY OUT OF ADVERTISING TO SINK IT INTO PROMOTIONS SUCH AS COUPONS AND SWEEPSTAKES IN THE PAST FEW YEARS 
KEVIN O'CONNELL SALES MANAGER AT TOYOTA OF ORANGE SAID OCTOBER WAS SLOWER THAN USUAL AT THE BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA DEALERSHIP 
THE PROBLEMS HE SAID ARE THE TRADITIONAL AFTER SUMMER BLUES IN THE LOCAL CAR MARKET AND THE STRONG JAPANESE YEN 
THERE'S PROBABLY A FEW PEOPLE WHO COME IN MORE SO THAN IN THE PAST AND SUFFER FROM STICKER SHOCK HE SAID 
THIS YEAR THE SOVIETS HAVE MOVED COMMERCIAL SALES TO THE FRONT BURNER 
THE EXPORT ARM OF THE SOVIET MINISTRY OF AVIATION INDUSTRY HOPES TO DOUBLE ITS REVENUE BY THE MID NINETEEN NINETIES 
BUT SUCH A SHIFT WOULD BRING MAJOR UPHEAVALS TO THE SOVIET SYSTEM 
ORDERS FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT HAVE FALLEN TWENTY PERCENT IN THE PAST TWO YEARS ACCORDING TO SOME ESTIMATES 
AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES PRESTIGIOUS MILITARY DESIGN BUREAUS IN THE SOVIET UNION ARE DEVOTING SUBSTANTIAL MANPOWER TO CIVILIAN PROJECTS 
THIS GROWING RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES TO SELL PRODUCTS COULD HINDER HEWLETT PACKARD'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESS AND MAKE THE COMPANY'S STOCK LESS ATTRACTIVE TO INVESTORS

OCCIDENTAL OFFICALS SAY THE MINE WILL START COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS NEXT SEPTEMBER MORE THAN TWO YEARS BEHIND SCHEDULE

NO DOUBT MR. CHUN KNOWS HE HAS TO STEP DOWN 
BUT THE POINT HERE IS THAT HE IS TRYING TO ARRANGE IT SO THAT HE WILL STILL WIELD THE REAL POWER FROM BEHIND THE SCENES EVEN AFTER HIS RESIGNATION 
HIS REPEATED EXPRESSIONS OF HIS WILLINGNESS TO STEP DOWN MUSTN'T BE SEEN AS AN EFFORT TO USHER IN SOME GENUINE DEMOCRATIC CHANGE IN KOREA 
WHAT KOREA IS NOW SUFFERING TO OVERCOME IS MAINLY A POLITICAL NOT ECONOMIC PROBLEM 
REFORMS THAT DO NOT CHANGE THE PRESENT POLITICAL SYSTEM ARE NOT REFORMS 
THE SYSTEM ISN'T ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PERFECT BUT IT'S WORKING REASONABLY WELL A FOREIGN MINISTER OFFICIAL TOLD REPORTERS 
THE OFFICIAL SAID THE U. S. HAS BEEN SIMILARLY REASSURED 
EVEN SO THE U. S. HAS INDICATED THAT IT WANTS JAPAN TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF HOW JAPANESE TECHNOLOGY IS SOLD AROUND THE WORLD 
THE LOAN IS PART OF A SEVENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PLAN TO EXPAND THE MINE'S RESERVES AND ALLOW IT TO KEEP OPERATING UNTIL NINETEEN NINETY FOUR

DAVID FLEISCHER AN ANALYST AT PRUDENTIAL BACHE SECURITIES THINKS TENNECO BY NINETEEN NINETY OR NINETEEN NINETY ONE COULD EARN EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE FROM EXISTING OPERATIONS 
THAT WOULD BE A SIXFOLD INCREASE FROM NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN PROFIT WHICH HE PUTS AT ONLY ONE DOLLAR AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE 
TENNECO STANDS TO BENEFIT GREATLY FROM A PICKUP AT ITS OIL AND GAS AND FARM EQUIPMENT BUSINESSES HE SAYS

IN ADDITION N. C. R. IS REPURCHASING ITS OWN SHARES IN THE OPEN MARKET MR. EXLEY SAID

MANY PARENTS IMPATIENT FOR CHANGE IN THE SCHOOLS RESPOND BY KEEPING THEIR KIDS OUT OF KINDERGARTEN AN EXTRA YEAR

THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL 
BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THIRD WORLD DEBTORS 
THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES 
THE CONTRACT NOW UNDER NEGOTIATION IS EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR IN VOLUME AND SCOPE TO THE CURRENT SEVENTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT

COMPUTER MAKERS AND THE CUSTOMS SERVICE DISAGREE OVER HOW MOTHER BOARDS WERE PREVIOUSLY TREATED FOR TARIFF PURPOSES

MANY ANALYSTS THOUGH HAD EXPECTED EVEN STRONGER GROWTH OF ABOUT FIVE PERCENT OR MORE 
MR. THAYER SAID MR. YOUNG RECEIVED A LUMP SUM PAYMENT TO SETTLE HIS CONTRACT WITH GIBRALTAR FINANCIAL BUT WOULDN'T DISCLOSE THE AMOUNT 
MR. YOUNG'S CONTRACT WHICH RAN UNTIL JANUARY TWENTY FOURTH NINETEEN NINETY ONE CALLED FOR A SALARY OF AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX MR. YOUNG WAS PAID FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED NINETY SIX DOLLARS 
OIL CHANGE CENTERS NUMBERED ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SEVEN FRANCHISED UNITS AT THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
THAT'S EXPECTED TO DOUBLE BY YEAR END WITH REVENUE REACHING SEVEN HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THE COMMERCE DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES 
JIFFY LUBE INTERNATIONAL INCORPORATED BALTIMORE IS THE LEADER WITH EIGHT HUNDRED FIFTY UNITS BUT COMPETITION IS BREWING AS OTHER FIRMS LOOK TO EXPAND 
THESE INCLUDE SOME MAJOR OIL COMPANIES INTERESTED IN BRAND AWARENESS 
CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH 
AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN 
MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS 
THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR 
THE POTENTIAL REWARD IS SIMPLY NOT WORTH THE RISK AN A. M. GENERAL SPOKESMAN SAID 
IF YOU DID A CASH FLOW CHART IT LOOKED AWFUL UNTIL WAY OUT IN THE FUTURE 
UNACCEPTABLY AWFUL 
AT THE SAME TIME THE REGION HAS BECOME A MECCA FOR DEVELOPERS ITS RATE OF POPULATION AND JOB GROWTH HAS SLOWED LEAVING SOME MARKETS SEVERELY OVERBUILT 
SUCH SUN BELT HOT SPOTS AS ATLANTA NASHVILLE AND PALM BEACH COUNTRY FLORIDA ARE ALL STRUGGLING 
IN THE LATTER THE OFFICE VACANCY RATE WAS HIT THIRTY TWO PERCENT AND SINGLE FAMILY HOUSING PERMITS ARE FORECAST TO DROP SEVENTEEN PERCENT THIS YEAR 
THAT'S WHAT WALL COVERING INDUSTRY EXECUTIVES DO 
LAST WEEKEND AT AN INDUSTRY GATHERING HERE NEARLY FIFTY OF THEM DRESSED UP IN FABRICS DESIGNED FOR BEDROOM BATHROOM AND OTHER HOUSEHOLD WALLS 
THEN AFTER A FEW ROUNDS OF DRINKS THEY STAGED A FASHION SHOW FOR HUNDREDS OF GUESTS 
AFTER NEARLY EIGHT YEARS OF THE REAGAN PRESIDENCY A KIND OF MORNING AFTER MOOD PREVAILS HERE 
THERE IS A SENSE THAT MR. REAGAN'S SUCCESSOR HASN'T ANY CHOICE BUT TO BE A CONSOLIDATION PRESIDENT 
GIVEN BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND A RE ENERGIZED CONGRESS SOME HERE BELIEVE A BUSH ADMINISTRATION MAY NOT BE ALL THAT DIFFERENT FROM A DUKAKIS ADMINISTRATION

ALL THE BLOCK TRADING ABILITY IN THE WORLD COULDN'T HAVE AVOIDED BIG PRICE DROPS IN SOME OF THOSE STOCKS ONCE THE BOESKY CASE WAS KNOWN HE SAID 
THE WAY THINGS HAVE DEVELOPED SO FAR IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN MIGHT OTHERWISE HAVE HAPPENED 
THE BIGGEST DANGER ECONOMISTS SAY IS A FREE FALL OF THE DOLLAR 
THAT WOULD FORCE THE U. S. TO RAISE INTEREST RATES TO ATTRACT THE FOREIGN CAPITAL NEEDED TO FINANCE ITS CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT AND INDIRECTLY ITS BUDGET DEFICIT 
HIGHER RATES IN TURN COULD PLUNGE THE U. S. AND POSSIBLY THE WORLD INTO A RECESSION THAT COULD THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL SYSTEM 
LIKE DREXEL MR. ICAHN HAS BEEN SUBPOENAED IN CONNECTION WITH THE GOVERNMENT'S CONTINUING INVESTIGATION OF THE BOESKY SCANDAL 
A SUBPOENA IS A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION AND DOESN'T IMPLY ANY WRONGDOING 
MR. ICAHN'S LAWYERS AT <UNK> <UNK> AND MANGES IN NEW YORK SAID THE INVESTIGATION HAD ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION WITH THE WITHDRAWAL OF MR. ICAHN'S BID 
THE ENERGY CONCERN SAID ITS BOARD MET THURSDAY AND WILL MEET AGAIN SHORTLY

NICHOLAS BRADY CHAIRMAN OF DILLON READ AND COMPANY SAID IN SENATE TESTIMONY LAST MONTH THAT HE IS CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IS PERMISSIBLE AND WHAT ISN'T 
THERE NEEDS TO BE CLARIFICATION OF EXACTLY WHAT CONDUCT IS TO BE PROHIBITED BY THE CONCEPT OF INSIDER TRADING SAID MR. BRADY 
THE BIG PROBLEM IS THAT DOCTOR THANOS CAN NO LONGER USE SO CALLED PASSIVE LOSSES FROM THESE PROPERTIES TO OFFSET HIS SALARY OR EARNED INCOME

JOHN JENNINGS VICE PRESIDENT OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS' ASSOCIATION SAID DOCTOR PECK MAY HAVE TWO SCIENTISTS BELOW HIM HANDLING DRUG REVIEW

DURING ANY REPAIR PROCESS BLOOD CLOTS ARE CONSTANTLY BEING FORMED AND DISSOLVED

INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE 
FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES 
PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES 
ODDLY AND SADLY NEITHER CANDIDATE HAS TALKED MUCH ABOUT THIS ISSUE

THE CONTRACT EXPIRES NEXT YEAR 
BUT HE WARNS THAT COMPANIES SHOULD ASK HOW MUCH STOCK IS TOO MUCH 
A DIRECTOR HOLDING A LARGE BLOCK MAY BECOME MORE INTERESTED IN SHORT TERM RESULTS THAN LONG TERM CORPORATE HEALTH 
THAT DIRECTOR MAY ALSO BE MORE TEMPTED TO VOTE HIS POCKETBOOK IN A TAKEOVER FIGHT SAYS MR. WOLF 
ALAN SCHWARTZ THE PLAINTIFF'S LAWYER OPPOSING BIC SAYS HE COULD HAVE AVOIDED HUNDREDS OF HOURS OF EXTRA WORK BY AGREEING TO TAKE THE DOCUMENTS UNDER A PROTECTIVE ORDER 
BUT HE IS LOOKING BEYOND HIS CASE 
THE NEXT PERSON INJURED HE EXPLAINS SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE SAME BATTLE I'VE ENGAGED IN 
WE HAVE ALWAYS CONSIDERED OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS PROGRAMS AS BEING PRETTY MUCH VANILLA AND NEVER THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS ANY WAY WE COULD BE DESCRIBED AS DISCRIMINATORY 
ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES WHETHER HIGHLY COMPENSATED OR NON HIGHLY COMPENSATED ARE OFFERED EXACTLY THE SAME BENEFITS PACKAGES 
WE DO NOT HAVE ANY BENEFITS THAT ARE SKEWED TOWARD THE HIGHLY COMPENSATED EMPLOYEES 
HOWEVER AS SECTION EIGHTY NINE IS WRITTEN WE FAIL THE DISCRIMINATION TESTS TOTALLY 
AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE 
DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES 
AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW 
ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT 
GOVERNOR DUKAKIS'S AIDES MAINTAIN AN ADMIRABLE PUBLIC OPTIMISM BUT IN PRIVATE MOMENTS ONE CAN DETECT A CREEPING DISMAY 
TO A PERSON THEY ATTRIBUTE THEIR SLIDE IN THE POLLS NOT TO ANY FAILURE IN THEIR MESSAGE BUT TO MR. BUSH'S LIES AND NEGATIVE CAMPAIGN 
ALL OF OUR STUFF SHOWS SAYS FIELD DIRECTOR CHARLIE BAKER THAT IF WE GET OUR MESSAGE OUT WE WIN 
THE OFFER IS BEING MADE THROUGH FARLEY INCORPORATED WHICH SAID NO AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE WITH ANY PARTIES TO BUY THE ASSETS IT PLANS TO SELL 
MR. FARLEY CONTROLS FARLEY INCORPORATED 
HE IS ALSO CHAIRMAN OF FRUIT OF THE LOOM INCORPORATED

LEBANON'S CURRENCY HAS LOST ABOUT EIGHTY PERCENT AGAINST THE VALUE OF THE U. S. DOLLAR THIS YEAR AND THE INFLATION RATE IS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PERCENT 
NEWS OF A DISAPPOINTING DECLINE IN THE AUGUST TRADE GAP PUSHED THE DOW JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE DOWN NEARLY NINETY SEVEN POINTS OCTOBER FOURTEENTH

CHRYSLER'S UNEMPLOYMENT FUND HAS BEEN DRAINED TO THE POINT THAT BENEFITS ARE ALREADY BEING REDUCED A U. A. W. SPOKESMAN SAID 
THE FUND HAS AT LEAST IN PART BEEN DRAINED BY WORKERS TEMPORARILY LAID OFF WHEN PLANTS WERE CLOSED DOWN FOR RETOOLING 
ONE REASON THE RATIOS FELL SO SHARPLY IN THE MONTH HE EXPLAINS IS THAT VOLUME DURING OCTOBER SOARED 
THAT RAISED THE AVERAGE DAY'S TRADING VOLUME 
IN THE COMING MONTH HE PREDICTS SHORT INTEREST RATIOS WILL RISE SINCE AVERAGE DAILY TRADING VOLUME HAS SINCE FALLEN

THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD ADDRESSED THE ISSUE IN BANCA COMMERCIALE'S PURCHASE OF LONG ISLAND TRUST COMPANY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO 
THE FED APPROVED THE PURCHASE AS IT HAD CLEARED SEVERAL SIMILAR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING SMALLER BANKS BOUGHT BY GOVERNMENT CONTROLLED FOREIGN INTERESTS IN THE PAST 
BUT FED APPROVAL TOOK FIFTEEN MONTHS AND THE BOARD SERVED NOTICE THAT THE LONG ISLAND TRUST CASE INVOLVED SIGNIFICANT AND COMPLEX PROBLEMS 
IT ADDED THAT MORE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS AND BROADER PARTICIPATION ARE NEEDED TO RESOLVE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUES 
NEVERTHELESS MR. BOZIAN AND MANY OTHER TRADERS ARE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT A GOVERNMENT REPORT ON INFLATION TO BE RELEASED TOMORROW MORNING

MANY CHEMICAL PLANTS ARE OPERATING FLAT OUT TO MEET DEMAND 
PRICE INTERESTS HAVE BEEN STICKING BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN CAUTIOUS IN EXPANDING CAPACITY

REACTING TO A WAVE OF LABOR UNREST THE COMMUNIST GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THE SPECIAL AUGUST THIRTY FIRST SESSION WOULD REVIEW ECONOMIC POLICIES AND PERHAPS ADJUST NATIONAL PRICE AND INCOME POLICIES 
THE INTERIOR MINISTER SAID AT LEAST TWENTY STRIKES HAVE BROKEN OUT AND AUTHORITIES EXTENDED A CURFEW AND DETAINED FORTY NINE PEOPLE NATIONWIDE 
SOME WORKERS ENDED STRIKES YESTERDAY BUT OTHERS PREPARED FOR ASSAULTS BY TROOPS AND RIOT POLICE 
IN ADDITION THE SECONDARY MARKET PROMISED BY SOME BROKERAGE HOUSES MAY PROVIDE LESS LIQUIDITY THAN A BANK OR THRIFT 
ON TOP OF THE EARLY WITHDRAWAL PENALTIES IMPOSED BY BANKS SOME BROKERAGE HOUSES IMPOSE THEIR OWN AS MUCH AS ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR A BIG C. D.

TAIPEI SHARES EXTENDED THEIR LOSSES FOR THE FIFTH DAY FOLLOWING SHARP DECLINES IN THE FINANCIAL SECTOR 
THE FALL WAS LED BY BANK STOCKS 
OTHER INDUSTRIAL SECTORS HOWEVER RECOVERED FROM RECENT DECLINES 
BUT IT'S WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ALL ABOUT 
THE REAL QUESTION ON THE BALLOT IS SHOULD THE REAGAN YEARS CONTINUE BEYOND THE REAGAN YEARS 
BEYOND THE BUSH YEARS

IT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED BY ITS SPONSORS AS A HOUSEKEEPING BILL DESIGNED TO GIVE LAWMAKERS MORE TIME TO DEBATE THRUST OF THE NATION'S HOUSING PROGRAMS

CERTAINLY FOREIGN COMPETITION AND A CHANGING WORLD ECONOMY HAVE EXACTED A HEAVY TOLL ON OUR NATION'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES

MR. ZEHNDER PLAYS DOWN THIS CRITICISM 
HE POINTS TO THE FACT THAT CREDIT SUISSE LEADS IN THE NUMBER OF PUBLICLY LISTED BONDS LAUNCHED BUT LAGS IN THE NUMBER OF UNLISTED NOTES IT ISSUED 
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT HE SAYS <UNK> BOND ISSUES PAY HIGHER COMMISSIONS THAN UNLISTED NOTES 
THE ADDITIONAL SHARES MAY HAVE BEEN BOUGHT IN THE OPEN MARKET OR IN PRIVATE TRANSACTIONS THE FILING SAID 
PENNANT ADDED HOWEVER THAT ITS INTENTION TO RAISE ITS STAKE IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE 
A BAY SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO COMMENT ON THE FILING 
THE FIRM NEITHER WOULD DISCLOSE HOW MUCH MONEY IT EXPECTS TO SAVE NOR SAY HOW MANY LAYOFFS MIGHT RESULT 
IN SOME CASES WHERE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS WERE MANAGING MORE THAN ONE FUND THEY PROBABLY WILL STAY ON MR. GLASSMAN SAID 
BUT HE SAID NO FINAL DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE 
PRICES OF SOME ACTIVELY TRADED THIRTY YEAR BONDS ROSE ONE QUARTER POINT OR TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS FOR EACH ONE THOUSAND DOLLAR FACE AMOUNT

ALSO THE TRANSACTION WON'T DISPEL DOUBTS ABOUT HOW MUCH CAPITAL INVESTORS ARE WILLING TO POUR INTO SICK THRIFTS IN THE DEPRESSED TEXAS ECONOMY

QUARTERLY COMMISSION REVENUE FELL THIRTY TWO PERCENT TO ONE HUNDRED THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

MR. QUALLS EXPECTS SALES TO SAG BADLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER CAUSING SUPPLIES OF UNSOLD VEHICLES TO RISE UNLESS AUTO MAKERS SHOW CONTINUED RESTRAINT IN PRODUCTION

THE PROBLEM IS SPECULATION BY TRADERS THAT VERGES ON PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE 
IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS 
THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER 
FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS 
THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR 
IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER 
SOME UTILITIES PARTICULARLY IN THE WEST HAVE SURPLUS CAPACITY MEANING THEY CAN SWITCH TO OTHER SOURCES IF HAULING COSTS AT A SINGLE PLANT RISE

YOU NEED TO BORROW FROM ABROAD TO FINANCE YOUR NATIONAL BUDGET 
WHY SHOULD ANYONE HERE OR ABROAD INVEST IN U. S. GOVERNMENT BONDS IF THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS COMMITTED TO A POLICY OF DEBASING ITS CURRENCY 
YOU WILL BE FORCED TO INCREASE YOUR INTEREST RATES AS DO THE ISSUERS OF JUNK BONDS 
AND THEN YOU WILL HAVE A CRASH 
THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY 
SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES 
THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION 
TECHNICALLY THE STOPGAP BILL WILL LEAVE THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF MONEY OVER THE WEEKEND

HOWEVER SUCH AN AGREEMENT MAY YET OCCUR 
THERE'S A LOT BREWING HERE SAID ONE SOURCE CLOSE TO APPLE 
THIS IS ONLY THE FIRST OF SEVERAL RELATED ANNOUNCEMENTS AND UNDERTAKINGS 
THE SOURCE SAID TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS ARE EASIER TO HAMMER OUT THAN MARKETING AGREEMENTS 
ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES 
SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES 
IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY 
TODAY'S GAMES RELY ON COMPUTER GENERATED IMAGES 
AS COMPUTER CHIPS HAVE BECOME MORE POWERFUL THE IMAGES HAVE BECOME MORE COMPLICATED AND VIVID BUT STILL AREN'T REALISTIC 
UNDER DEVELOPMENT HOWEVER ARE GAMES IN WHICH THE PLAYERS INTERACT WITH VIDEOTAPE SCENES 
AS FOR THE STICKERS FEW FORD DRIVERS EVEN APPLIED THEM 
ONLY ABOUT SEVEN PERCENT DID ACCORDING TO A SPOT CHECK BY THE CENTER FOR AUTO SAFETY 
AND FORD NEVER REACHED MORE THAN TWO MILLION OWNERS AT ALL 
MANY DEBT HOLDERS SHRUGGED OFF THE F. D. I. C.'S THREAT TO ALLOW FIRST CITY'S BANKS TO FAIL 
AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED 
BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS 
IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES 
A SIMILAR VIEW IS HELD BY GRETA E. MARSHALL INVESTMENT MANAGER OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM WHICH MANAGES ABOUT FORTY FOUR POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS 
I STILL SEE NO EVIDENCE THAT INFLATION IS PICKING UP SUBSTANTIALLY SHE SAYS 
THE ECONOMY DOESN'T LOOK SO STRONG THAT IT WILL REKINDLE INFLATION SO I WOULD VIEW ANY FURTHER DROP IN BOND PRICES AS A BUYING OPPORTUNITY 
CRITICS ARGUE THAT HE MAY BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC THOUGH 
AND MR. DUKAKIS IS CERTAIN TO FACE MORE PRESSURE ON THE QUESTION FROM VICE PRESIDENT BUSH WHO SUPPORTS BOTH THE M. X. AND MIDGETMAN 
MOREOVER MOST OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS BEING CONSIDERED AS POTENTIAL RUNNING MATES FOR GOVERNOR DUKAKIS HAVE BACKED ONE OR THE OTHER MISSILE PLANS 
THE DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL PENDING IN CONGRESS IS EXPECTED TO PUT OFF ANY DECISION UNTIL A NEW ADMINISTRATION TAKES OFFICE NEXT YEAR 
APOLLO IS THE SECOND LARGEST COMPUTER RESERVATIONS SYSTEM IN THE U. S. BEHIND SABRE 
IN MAY UNITED AGREED TO SELL A HALF INTEREST IN APOLLO TO FOUR EUROPEAN AIRLINES AND U. S. AIR GROUP INCORPORATED FOR NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS 
THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THAT TRANSACTION 
BUT THERE IS ALWAYS THE RISK THAT REVIVING A CLASSIC SLOGAN OR SPOKESMAN WILL BACKFIRE AND CREATE AN OLD FASHIONED IMAGE FOR A BRAND 
TO GUARD AGAINST THAT MARKETEERS TEND TO GIVE THEIR RECYCLED ADS A CONTEMPORARY TWIST 
THE CAPTAIN RAID OF NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE HAS RIPPLING MUSCLES AND A FUTURISTIC LOOK 
AND A WOMAN IN ONE OF THE NEW NESTEA SPOTS DOESN'T JUST TUMBLE INTO A SWIMMING POOL SHE FALLS ONTO AN EXERCISE MAT THAT TURNS INTO A POOL 
THAT SAID MR. QUAYLE HAS CLEARLY SHOWN HE CAN LEARN FAST 
IN TWELVE YEARS IN CONGRESS AND ESPECIALLY FROM HIS ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE POST IN THE SENATE MR. QUAYLE HAS MADE HIMSELF AN INTELLIGENT ADVOCATE OF U. S. DEFENSE 
HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DETAILS OF STRATEGY HAS LED HIM TO SUPPORT SUCH VALUABLE BUT ARCANE HIGH TECHNOLOGY WEAPONS AS CONVENTIONALLY ARMED CRUISE MISSILES 
THESE HAVE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE NATO DETERRENCE EVEN AS THEY REDUCE DEFENSE COSTS 
OVERALL CONSUMER SPENDING HAS SLOWED SINCE LAST YEAR'S STOCK MARKET CRASH BUT IT'S STILL AT A LEVEL THAT WORRIES SOME ECONOMISTS 
CONSUMER CREDIT SLOWED SHARPLY IN JULY REFLECTING SLUGGISH SALES 
TOO MUCH SPENDING AT HOME COUPLED WITH HEAVY DEMAND FOR EXPORTS COULD OVERLOAD AN INDUSTRIAL SECTOR THAT IS ALREADY RUNNING NEAR CAPACITY 
HITLER AND STALIN WERE FRIENDS SAYS AN OLD MAN TURNING IN HIS SEAT TO FACE MR. SEMIONENKOV 
ANOTHER WALKS TO THE BACK OF THE BUS 
THE POLISH PEOPLE KNEW IT LONG AGO 
IT WAS THE RUSSIANS 
ONE STUMBLING BOCK TO INCREASED COMPETITION IS THE VERTICAL INTEGRATION AND CROSS OWNERSHIP IN THE INDUSTRY 
CABLE SYSTEMS OFTEN HAVE DEMANDED A STAKE IN THE CHANNELS THEY TRANSMIT 
AN ENTREPRENEUR IS RELUCTANT TO START AN ALTERNATIVE CABLE SYSTEM IF HE KNOWS THAT HE WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO GAIN ACCESS TO PROGRAMMING 
QUITE POSSIBLY SOME OF THE ANTITRUST ASPECTS OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS DESERVE A LOOK SO IT CAN BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY ACT TO FURTHER INHIBIT COMPETITION IN THE INDUSTRY

I WOULD BE DEFEATED BEFORE I WOULD ACCEPT CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS 
BUT FREEDOM ISN'T AN ACCIDENT 
IT IS THE RESULT OF PAINSTAKING WORK TO MAINTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF LIBERTY AGAINST INEVITABLE EROSION AT THE HANDS OF THE GOVERNMENT 
I THOUGHT THAT MY WORK FOR THE A. C. L. U. WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF MAINTAINING FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE

NOW HOWEVER IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT MONSIEUR MITTERRAND WILL DISSOLVE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND CALL A NEW ELECTION 
POLLS SHOW THAT THE SOCIALISTS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF WINNING AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY IF ELECTIONS WERE HELD NOW ENABLING MESSRS. 
MITTERRAND AND ROCARD TO GOVERN WITHOUT RELYING ON THE CENTRISTS

IT WOULD REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO IDENTIFY COUNTRIES THAT DON'T PROTECT COPYRIGHTS AND PATENTS AND TO INITIATE EXPEDITED UNFAIR TRADE INVESTIGATIONS IN THE MOST EGREGIOUS CASES 
THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT DECLINE TO MOVE AGAINST CERTAIN COUNTRIES IF DOING SO WOULD BE AGAINST THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC INTEREST THOUGH

BUT UNION OFFICIALS SAID THE COMPANY HAS TOSSED AROUND NUMBERS FROM ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TO TWO THOUSAND 
SOME CRITICS SEE THE GROWTH CONTROL MOVEMENT AS THE INDULGENCE OF A SELF SATISFIED MIDDLE CLASS 
AND SOME CHARGE THAT THERE ARE RACIST ROOTS 
THE FACT IS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE SEEING HISPANICS AND ASIANS AROUND SAYS DANIEL GARCIA THE PRESIDENT OF THE LOS ANGELES PLANNING COMMISSION 
THE COMPANY SAYS IT INTENDS TO PURCHASE THOSE SHARES TENDERED AT OR BELOW TWENTY EIGHT DOLLARS A SHARE 
SHARES TENDERED AT HIGHER PRICES WILL BE RETURNED TO HOLDERS TORCHMARK SAID

FORD'S FOURTH QUARTER SALES WERE EIGHTEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS UP FIFTEEN PERCENT FROM SIXTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR EARLIER 
FULL YEAR SALES ROSE FOURTEEN PERCENT TO SEVENTY ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS FROM SIXTY TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS 
THAT LARGE JUMP ENABLED FORD TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE U. S. NEW CAR MARKET TO TWENTY POINT TWO PERCENT FROM EIGHTEEN POINT TWO PERCENT 
DAVID DENTON AN ASSOCIATE U. S. ATTORNEY IN MANHATTAN DEFENDS THE GOVERNMENT'S TACTICS 
SEARCH WARRANTS ARE USED WHEN THEY APPEAR APPROPRIATE IN A PARTICULAR CASE MR. DENTON SAYS NOTING THAT A FEDERAL MAGISTRATE OR JUDGE MAKES THE DETERMINATION 
IN OAKLEY SUTTON'S CASE THE GOVERNMENT SUBMITTED A SEALED AFFIDAVIT TO SUPPORT ITS REQUEST FOR THE WARRANT 
ACCORDING TO PEOPLE CLOSE TO THE INVESTIGATION THE AFFIDAVIT CONTAINS INFORMATION PROVIDED BY A DISGRUNTLED FORMER OAKLEY SUTTON EMPLOYEE WHO WAS FIRED PRIOR TO THE RAID 
MR. DENTON NOTES THAT FEDERAL AGENTS ARE ROUTINELY ARMED AND THAT THE LARGE NUMBER OF AGENTS USED MAY SIMPLY REFLECT THE VOLUME OF DOCUMENTS BEING SEIZED 
IN ADDITION LAURENTIAN SAID BERNHARD M. KOCH THIRTY THREE WAS NAMED VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

JUST BEFORE THE OCTOBER NINETEENTH GLOBAL EQUITIES CRASH HONGKONG BANK ECONOMISTS EXPRESSED SIMILAR CONCERN ABOUT THE SPECULATION THAT THEN DOMINATED THE LOCAL STOCK MARKET 
THEIR PROPERTY REPORT RECALLS THE EQUITIES CRASH AS A REMINDER THAT ASSET VALUES CANNOT DEFY GRAVITY FOR EVER 
THIS WARNING NOW REPRESENTS A MINORITY VIEW 
BUT CRITICS CHARGED THAT THE COLLAR ACTUALLY ADDED TO VOLATILITY BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR INDEX ARBITRAGERS TO DO THEIR BUSINESS 
MANY TRADERS ARGUE THAT SUCH ARBITRAGE HAS THE EFFECT OF SMOOTHING OUT VOLATILITY IN THE MARKETS 
INDEX ARBITRAGERS BUY AND SELL LARGE AMOUNTS OF STOCKS AND STOCK INDEX FUTURES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF BRIEF PRICE DISPARITIES BETWEEN THE TWO RELATED INSTRUMENTS 
SECRETARIES ARE ALSO EASY TARGETS FOR A HUG ESPECIALLY IN HOLLYWOOD

BUT THE PAPER ADDS THE LIKELIHOOD OF A BUSH VICTORY DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL BE SAFE 
INDEED THE NEW U. S. TRADE BILL GIVES THE WHITE HOUSE LESS ROOM TO SIDESTEP PUNISHING JAPAN FOR TRADE VIOLATIONS 
UNDER PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS CORPORATE BAILOUTS AND RESTRUCTURINGS WERE COMMON 
BUT SOME LED TO CHARGES OF CORRUPTION THAT ARE NOW BEING INVESTIGATED IN THE OPPOSITION CONTROLLED NATIONAL ASSEMBLY 
PRESIDENT ROH TAE WOO'S GOVERNMENT DOESN'T WANT TO PROVOKE SIMILAR SUSPICIONS NOR DOES IT WANT TO APPEAR TO BE SHORING UP ANOTHER FAILING COMPANY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE 
THE DOLLAR WAS CONFINED TO FAIRLY NARROW RANGES IN ASIAN AND EARLY EUROPEAN TRADING AS MARKET PARTICIPANTS CONCENTRATED ON MARK YEN TRADING 
THE GERMAN CURRENCY TRADED IN A RANGE BETWEEN SEVENTY THREE POINT THREE OH YEN AND SEVENTY THREE POINT SIX FIVE YEN THROUGH MOST OF NEW YORK TRADING 
AT THE NEW YORK FINISH THE MARK WAS UNCHANGED AT SEVENTY THREE POINT FOUR SIX YEN 
HIGHER COMMISSIONS CAN ALSO REDUCE THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES THAT INCLUDE A SAVINGS COMPONENT SUCH AS UNIVERSAL LIFE POLICIES 
IN GENERAL POLICIES WITH HIGHER COMMISSIONS HAVE LOWER SURRENDER VALUES

YESTERDAY'S G. N. P. FIGURES WERE WITHIN GENERAL EXPECTATIONS SUSUMU TAKETOMI SENIOR ECONOMIST FOR INDUSTRIAL BANK OF JAPAN LIMITED SAID 
THE BANK HAD PREDICTED GROWTH OF TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT

SENATOR BENTSEN'S CORPORATE TAX PROPOSAL WOULD REPLACE A PROVISION IN THE COMMITTEE BILL ALLOWING THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TO WITHHOLD REFUNDS FROM TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE DEFAULTED ON GOVERNMENT LOANS

THE GROUP SAID IN THE FILING THAT IT ACQUIRED THE STOCK FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES 
A SPOKESMAN FOR THE INVESTOR GROUP DECLINED TO ELABORATE ON THE FILING 
GREENMAN OFFICIALS WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT 
THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR ITS PREFERRED SHARES AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS A SHARE 
MOST OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRED TO RETIRE THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE BORROWED MR. MOORE SAID 
AT THE SAME TIME THE COMPANY WOULD RESTRUCTURE EXISTING BANK LOANS 
FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION 
IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS 
IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE 
THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER

I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS 
BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM 
ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS 
INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID 
AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS 
YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN 
BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND 
I READ HIS BOOK 
BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN D. OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC 
THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS 
SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY 
MR. GORBACHEV'S EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE THE SOVIET ECONOMY RAISE THE PROSPECTS OF WIDENING COMMERCIAL TIES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST 
MOSCOW'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM AFGHANISTAN HAS REDUCED U. S. FEARS OF SOVIET EXPANSION 
MOST IMPORTANT MR. REAGAN LIKE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER FINDS THAT HE CAN DEAL WITH MR. GORBACHEV 
THE SUPERPOWER CHIEFS HAVE NEGOTIATED ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND TALKED OF ENDING THE ARMS RACE 
THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR 
THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES 
UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT 
COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS 
THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS 
CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY 
INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT 
PERNOD SAYS THE FYFFES SHARE WOULD GIVE IT CONTROL OF MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF IRISH DISTILLERS STOCK 
IF THE COURT DEEMS THE ORAL AGREEMENT INVALID THE BIDDING WOULD REOPEN 
BUT REGARDLESS OF THE COURT DECISION THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION OR IRELAND'S FAIR TRADE COMMISSION COULD BLOCK ANY BID 
NOT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HAVE CITIZENS PLACED SO MANY INITIATIVES ON STATE BALLOTS 
MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES 
WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY 
A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATORS ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT 
NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES 
IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS

MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED

BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT 
BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS 
SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND 
IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M. 
ONE INDICATION THAT PATTERN BARGAINING MAY BE BREAKING DOWN IS THE WIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AUTO MAKERS' INITIAL PROPOSALS 
IN THE PAST BOTH COMPANIES HAVE PRESENTED VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL OFFERS ON THE SAME DAY 
A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS 
THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS 
THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM 
I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID 
EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION

THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR

BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS 
THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS 
BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT 
THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES 
IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS 
I TOLD THEM THEY SHOULDN'T SIGN THE DEAL AND I HAD EVERYBODY MAD AT ME SAYS THE ATTORNEY

CARBIDE'S CHIEF DERIVATIVE FROM ETHYLENE OXIDE ETHYLENE GLYCOL IS USED IN ANTI FREEZE AND POLYESTER FIBER 
SHIPMENTS ALSO ARE HOLDING UP WELL SO FAR THOUGH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE FOR SEASONAL REASONS AFTER THANKSGIVING HE SAID 
NOT TO WORRY IT ADDS BECAUSE MAJOR CARRIERS BY CONTROLLING ROUTES AND MAJOR HUBS AREN'T AS VULNERABLE AS PREVIOUSLY TO COMPETITION 
THEY ALSO HAVE HIDDEN SALABLE ASSETS SUCH AS AIRPORT GATES LANDING SLOTS ROUTES AND PLANES 
THEY MANAGE FARE STRUCTURES MORE EFFICIENTLY 
AND THEY BENEFIT FROM HIGH OPERATING LEVERAGE 
FOR EXAMPLE SALOMON SAYS A HALF PENNY INCREASE IN YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE WOULD BOOST UNITED'S OPERATING INCOME BY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

IT ALSO WILL RETAIN SMALLER FORD ACCOUNTS IN SIX OTHER COUNTRIES AND IT CONTINUES TO BE FORD'S LARGEST AGENCY 
BUT INDUSTRY SOURCES SAID THEY BELIEVED FORD WAS CONSIDERING GIVING ONE OF THOSE SIX ACCOUNTS FOR FORD'S LATIN AMERICAN AFFILIATE TO ANOTHER AGENCY 
HERE ARE PRICE TRENDS ON THE WORLD'S MAJOR STOCK MARKETS AS CALCULATED BY MORGAN STANLEY CAPITAL INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVE GENEVA 
TO MAKE THEM DIRECTLY COMPARABLE EACH INDEX IS BASED ON THE CLOSE OF NINETEEN SIXTY NINE EQUALING ONE HUNDRED 
THE PERCENTAGE CHANGE IS SINCE YEAR END 
BUT ON TUESDAY KIDDER PEABODY'S JACK KIRNAN DROPPED CHRYSLER INTO A HOLD RATING 
VANS AND TRUCKS ARE SELLING WELL HE CONCEDES BUT CHRYSLER'S CAR SALES HAVE BEEN VERY DISAPPOINTING 
HE ALSO FIGURES CHRYSLER WILL TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AMERICAN MOTORS WHICH IT ACQUIRED WEDNESDAY 
COFFEE FUTURE PRICES ROSE STRONGLY AMID SIGNS THAT CENTRAL AMERICAN COFFEE PRODUCING NATIONS ARE MORE TIGHTLY UNITED IN FAVORING RESTORATION OF COFFEE EXPORT QUOTAS 
THE PRODUCERS BEGAN MEETING FRIDAY IN MEXICO CITY AND CONCLUDED YESTERDAY 
BRAZILIAN AND COLOMBIAN REPRESENTATIVES WERE OBSERVERS AND DIDN'T PARTICIPATE 
AN ANNOUNCEMENT AFTER THE FINAL SESSION SAID THE MEETINGS HELPED CONSOLIDATE THE PRODUCERS POSITIONS REGARDING THE NEED TO REIMPOSE QUOTAS 
THE INTERNATIONAL COFFEE ORGANIZATION'S COUNCIL ITSELF MEETS NEXT WEEK IN LONDON 
JAPANESE INVESTORS ARE MORE NERVOUS THAN BEFORE SAID A MANAGER OF FOREIGN EQUITY TRADING AT A MAJOR JAPANESE BROKERAGE HOUSE 
IF THE NEW YORK MARKET DROPS TWENTY PERCENT IT IS A SIGNAL THAT THE BULL MARKET IS OVER 
BUT I DON'T THINK THAT WILL HAPPEN 
SOUTHLAND WOULD HAVE ABOUT FOUR POINT EIGHT NINE BILLION DOLLARS OF DEBT AFTER THE BUY OUT IS COMPLETED 
THE COMPANY PLANS TO PAY OFF ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF THAT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE LARGELY FROM THE SALE OF ASSETS 
SOUTHLAND EXPECTS PROCEEDS FROM ASSET SALES TO TOTAL EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR 
BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE 
IT SEEMS TO BE IN PEOPLE'S INTEREST TO KEEP THE PRICE DOWN RIGHT NOW SAYS ONE LONDON EXCHANGE TRADER 
THIS WILL ULTIMATELY GIVE THEM MORE BUYING OPPORTUNITIES DOWN THE LINE 
OTHER GAFFES MAKE VOTERS QUESTION HIS GRASP OF ISSUES 
AT A NEWS CONFERENCE HE CONFUSED TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS WITH NUCLEAR ENERGY PLANTS 
THE AVID JOGGER EVERY MORNING AT SIX A. M. AND MOUNTAIN CLIMBER ONCE A WEEK COMES CLOSE TO CONCEDING INTELLECTUAL FAILINGS 
MEANWHILE THE SECURITIES FIRM'S PARENT COMPANY PRUDENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY OF AMERICA REPORTED MODEST GAINS IN MOST FINANCIAL CATEGORIES

CURRENT BENEFITS TO POLICYHOLDERS ROSE TWO POINT NINE PERCENT TO FOURTEEN POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS FROM THIRTEEN POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS 
PROFIT FROM OPERATIONS BEFORE DIVIDENDS AND FEDERAL INCOME TAX INCHED UP TO TWO POINT SIX FIVE BILLION DOLLARS FROM TWO POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS 
COTTON FUTURES PRICES FOR COTTON FROM THE CURRENT CROP ROSE ON BUYING MOSTLY BY TRADERS WHO FOLLOW CHART SIGNALS 
THE ADVANCE IN TURN PULLED UP PRICES OF DELIVERY MONTHS REPRESENTING THE NEW CROP SEASON WHICH WILL BEGIN AUGUST FIRST 
THE JULY DELIVERY ROSE ONE POINT FIVE NINE CENTS A POUND TO SIXTY FOUR POINT FOUR EIGHT CENTS 
THE OCTOBER CONTRACT WAS UP ZERO POINT FIVE EIGHT CENT TO SIXTY POINT THREE SIX CENTS A POUND 
ONE ANALYST OBSERVED THAT NEW CROP CONTRACTS WERE UNDER PRESSURE EARLIER IN THE DAY BECAUSE OF THE PERCEPTION THAT MOISTURE IN THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA MIGHT BE HEAVIER THAN NEEDED 
BUT LATER IN THE SESSION TRADERS CHANGED THEIR MINDS HE SAID DECIDING THAT RAIN MIGHT NOT BE ADEQUATE 
THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER WOULD HAVE BOTH THE FOOTWEAR AND APPAREL BUSINESSES REPORTING TO HIM 
MR. SHELTON HAD LED AN IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF THE LATTER DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS 
HE ALSO HAS A LONGER TERM RELATIONSHIP WITH COMPANY CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER WILLIAM S. WIRE THE SECOND WORKING FOR GENESCO SINCE NINETEEN FIFTY SIX 
HOWEVER CONVENTIONAL FILM WILL BE MARGINALLY PROFITABLE AT BEST FOR POLAROID BECAUSE INITIALLY POLAROID WON'T BE MANUFACTURING THE FILM CONTENDS ELLIOTT NOVAK AN INDUSTRY CONSULTANT 
INSTEAD IT WILL BUY THE FILM FROM ANOTHER COMPANY AND PUT ITS NAME ON IT JUST AS IT DOES WITH VIDEOTAPE 
SINCE IT BEGAN SELLING VIDEOTAPE A FEW YEARS AGO POLAROID HAS BUILT UP AN IMPRESSIVE TWELVE PERCENT MARKET SHARE MAKING IT THE LEADER IN THE U. S. 
BUT FIERCE COMPETITION HAS KEPT VIDEOTAPE PROFITS SLIM AND THE CONVENTIONAL FILM BUSINESS ISN'T LIKELY TO PROVE ANY BONANZA EITHER 
AS THE STATE DEPARTMENT SAID IT WAS DEVISING PLANS FOR THE EVACUATION OF AMERICANS FROM THE ASIAN NATION THIEVES LOOTED GOVERNMENT OFFICES AND WAREHOUSES THROUGHOUT RANGOON 
STATE RADIO SAID SECURITY FORCES SHOT FIVE LOOTERS 
OPPOSITION LEADERS MEANWHILE CALLED FOR A NATIONWIDE GENERAL STRIKE TODAY TO PROTEST TWENTY SIX YEARS OF ONE PARTY RULE 
PROTESTS HAVE DRIVEN TWO GOVERNMENTS FROM OFFICE IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS 
BUT YAMAICHI DENIED THE RUMORS 
THIS MAKES A DOZEN CALLS I'VE HAD ON THIS TODAY SAID AN ANNOYED TRADING OFFICIAL AT YAMAICHI'S NEW YORK BASED U. S. SUBSIDIARY 
HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE FIRM ACTIVELY SOLD S. AND P. FIVE HUNDRED FUTURES LAST WEEK AND THAT DEAN WITTER HANDLED SOME OF THE SALES 
BUT HE ADDED THAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN A HEAVY SELLER AT ALL THIS WEEK 
LAST YEAR THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED PLANS TO REVIVE THE PANEL BUT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED YET 
AS A RESULT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STILL CAN'T FUND RESEARCH THAT MAY OFFER HOPE TO THE NATION'S TWO POINT FOUR MILLION INFERTILE MARRIED COUPLES 
ALL THE RESEARCH IS PRIVATE 
THEN MIKHAIL GORBACHEV AND WOJCIECH JARUZELSKI DECIDED TO CLEAR THE AIR 
TWO YEARS AGO THEY COMMISSIONED A PANEL OF HISTORIANS TO FILL IN THE BLANK SPOTS OF THE SOVIET POLISH PAST 
KATYN LED THE AGENDA FOR THE PANEL'S POLES BUT THE SOVIET SIDE BALKED 
DREDGING UP KATYN SAID ONE OF ITS MEMBERS WOULD ONLY FOMENT ANTI SOVIET SENTIMENT IN THE POLISH PUBLIC 
OUR PROBLEM IS GETTING THIS VERY VERY ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO ACTUALLY WORK SAYS ANTHONY SIMONDS GOODING BRITISH SATELLITE'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
OUR CREDIBILITY IS CLOSE TO ZERO UNTIL THEN 
SOME ANALYSTS TAKE A HARSHER VIEW 
THERE IS A SERIOUS QUESTION MARK OVER B. S. B. MANAGEMENT SAYS MARK ASTAIRE A MEDIA ANALYST AT U. K. BROKERS HOARE GOVETT LIMITED 
SO FAR EVERYTHING HAS GONE WRONG 
IN EARLY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE POLITICAL SETTLEMENT ENVISAGED BY THE NON COMMUNISTS SEEMED PLAUSIBLE 
SOVIET LEADER MIKHAIL GORBACHEV WAS A MAJOR REASON 
MR. GORBACHEV SAW THE EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS OF HIS PREDECESSORS STYMIED BY THE RESOLUTE CONTAINMENT POLICY OF BOTH CHINA AND THE PRO WESTERN ASEAN POWERS 
SUPPORT FOR THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION OF CAMBODIA COST THE SOVIET UNION ECONOMICALLY AND DIPLOMATICALLY 
SO THE SOVIETS TRYING TO ELIMINATE THE MILITARY QUAGMIRE IN CAMBODIA PERSUADED HANOI'S LEADERS TO NEGOTIATE A MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM CAMBODIA

DEPENDING ON THE PERSON'S NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX TAX BRACKET THAT CAN SAVE UP TO ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN FEDERAL TAXES 
LAST OCTOBER SIX HUNDRED OF ITS ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE AFTER THEIR CONTRACT EXPIRED 
THE PLANTS CONTINUED TO OPERATE AT REDUCED CAPACITY DURING THE STRIKE AND A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID ALL WORKERS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN WITHIN A WEEK 
DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT WEREN'T DISCLOSED BUT THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT OFFERED MODEST WAGE INCREASES 
LAST APRIL THE CUSTOMS SERVICE SAID THE COMPANY SUBMITTED AN OFFER OF TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SETTLE ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF U. S. IMPORT RESTRICTIONS 
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS WHO BELIEVE THE OFFER INVOLVED THE ISSUES IN THE CIVIL SUIT SAID THE PROPOSAL WAS REJECTED AND THE DISPUTE REFERRED TO THE DEPARTMENT 
DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS SAID THEY UNDERSTAND THAT MR. DEAVER NO LONGER REPRESENTS THE COMPANY ADDING THAT HE WASN'T INVOLVED IN ANY DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AGENCY BEFORE THE COURT ACTION 
THE OUTLOOK IN THE SENATE IS STILL CLOUDY AS LONG AS PRESIDENT REAGAN CONTINUES TO OPPOSE A TAX BOOST

AFTER MUCH CONFLICT SECRETARY OF STATE CYRUS VANCE STRUCK A DEAL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN 
THE EMBASSY COMPLEX HAD TO BE OCCUPIED SIMULTANEOUSLY 
CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOVIET UNION'S WASHINGTON EMBASSY WAS COMPLETED BY NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE BEFORE WORK ON THE U. S.'S NEW MOSCOW EMBASSY HAD EVEN STARTED 
THE SOVIETS THEN PUSHED TO OCCUPY THEIR NEW SITE BUT THE U. S. RESISTED UNTIL ITS OWN BUILDINGS WERE READY 
AS THE U. S. BUILDINGS WERE COMPLETED IN MOSCOW THE SOVIETS WERE ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO SOME OF THEIR NEW FACILITIES ON MOUNT ALTO 
ONLY THE MAIN AMBASSADORIAL BUILDINGS AT EACH SITE ARE VACANT

THE BANK OF JAPAN SOMETIMES RELUCTANTLY DID THE JOB 
FIVE TIMES THE CENTRAL BANK CUT INTEREST RATES REDUCING ITS DISCOUNT RATE ITS RATE ON LOANS TO COMMERCIAL BANKS TO TWO POINT FIVE PERCENT 
WITH CHEAPER MONEY JAPAN WENT ON A BUILDING BOOM 
AGE DISCRIMINATION IS OFTEN THE BASIS FOR LEGAL ACTION BY AN EMPLOYEE AGAINST HIS FORMER COMPANY 
WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF THE DEPARTMENTS 
THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER 
A VERY SIMILAR CASE OCCURRED WITH ANOTHER NATIONAL RETAILER THAT SOUGHT TO REDUCE ITS OVERHEAD AND OPERATING EXPENSES 
ANOTHER LARGE CLASS ACTION SUIT ALSO BASED ON THE CHARGE OF AGE DISCRIMINATION IS PENDING AGAINST A LEADING MIDWESTERN BANK 
REMEMBER THE ONE ABOUT THE INVESTMENT BANKER 
IT WAS WIDELY TOLD CIRCA OCTOBER NINETEENTH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND WENT LIKE THIS WHAT DO YOU CALL AN INVESTMENT BANKER 
HEY WAITER 
UNFAIR OR NOT THE QUESTIONS ARE BEING ASKED ABOUT BOTH THE REVOLUTION'S ROUTE AND ITS GOALS HOW MUCH VIOLENCE WILL THERE BE

HOW MANY WHITES WILL LOSE THEIR <UNK> 
HOW COMMUNIST IS THE A. N. C. 
HOW MUCH WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL THE ECONOMY 
ONE LONGTIME EASTERN PILOT INSISTED THAT THE SAFETY CAMPAIGN INVOLVED NUMEROUS SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT AFFIRMED THAT THE CARDS OFTEN CONTAINED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR REGULATORS TO ACT ON 
I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS 
BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM 
ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS 
INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID 
NOW HOWEVER IT APPEARS INCREASINGLY LIKELY THAT MR. MITTERRAND WILL DISSOLVE THE NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AND CALL A NEW ELECTION

THE TEXSTYRENE CASE ALSO ILLUSTRATES THE SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DREXEL AND EXECUTIVE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY A SUBSIDIARY OF FIRST EXECUTIVE CORPORATION IN LOS ANGELES 
DREXEL KEPT NINE MILLION DOLLARS OF THE TEXSTYRENE BONDS IT HAD BOUGHT BACK FROM ITS EMPLOYEE ACCOUNTS FOR ONE HUNDRED SIX AND ONE HALF FOR ONLY TWO TRADING DAYS 
IT THEN SOLD TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF TEXSTYRENE BONDS FOR ONE HUNDRED EIGHT POINT TWO TO EXECUTIVE LIFE 
THE INDICATED TIGHTNESS IN U. S. GASOLINE OUGHT TO PREVENT THE REFINERS' FLAT OUT PRODUCTION FROM LEADING TO A PRODUCT PRICE WAR 
THE DECLINE IN CRUDE PRICES EVENTUALLY WILL END HOWEVER 
OR PRODUCT PRICES COULD AGAIN BECOME LINKED TO THOSE FOR CRUDE 
AND GASOLINE DEMAND USUALLY DROPS AFTER LABOR DAY 
BUT MR. RANDOL SUGGESTS THAT A TREND TOWARDS PERMANENTLY IMPROVED REFINER MARGINS IS SUSTAINABLE 
ANOTHER CONDITION IS THAT TOPEKA GROUP A UNIT OF DULUTH MINNESOTA BASED MINNESOTA POWER AND LIGHT COMPANY EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO BUY DELTONA'S UTILITY SUBSIDIARIES 
BASED ON CURRENT BOOK VALUE THE SUBSIDIARIES WOULD FETCH THIRTY TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN CASH PLUS PREFERRED STOCK IN ONE OF THE UTILITY UNITS

MR. KAVNER WAS BORN IN FRANKLIN SQUARE N. Y. A LONG ISLAND SUBURB OF NEW YORK CITY

A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE

ALMOST ALL THE MAJOR OFFICE FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS HAVE ACQUIRED THE ABILITY TO MAKE WOOD SYSTEMS IN RECENT YEARS 
MANA SAID OTAIBA THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES OIL MINISTER HAD BEEN MENTIONED AS THE POSSIBLE NEW PRESIDENT 
HE HAS HELD THE POSITION THREE TIMES IN THE PAST AND WAS BELIEVED EAGER TO HEAD OPEC AGAIN

THE ONLY NEW ISSUE PRICED YESTERDAY WAS FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS OF TWELVE YEAR SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURES FROM U. S. G. CORPORATION 
THE HIGH RISK HIGH YIELD ISSUE WAS PRICED AT PAR TO YIELD THIRTEEN AND ONE QUARTER PERCENT BY SALOMON BROTHERS INCORPORATED AND GOLDMAN SACHS AND COMPANY 
THE OFFERING IS PART OF U. S. G.'S RECAPITALIZATION PLAN 
INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY 
EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED 
IN THE CURRENT DEBATE MR. BUSH IS USING THE A. C. L. U. TO PIN A LIBERAL LABEL ON HIS DEMOCRATIC CHALLENGER 
BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES 
IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT 
MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT 
IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES HE WAS A GLOBALLY MINDED FINANCE MINISTER UNDER PIERRE TRUDEAU 
LIBERALS LED A ROYAL COMMISSION THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE ENDORSED FREE TRADE AS THE BEST WAY FOR CANADA TO REACH ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL 
LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE 
WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND 
MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS 
BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF RICO THAN FROM REAL FELONS 
THE LAST QUESTION WAS ALL BUT IGNORED 
ALMOST EVERYONE REGARDLESS OF LABEL AGREED THAT THIS WAS A DEFICIT THAT REALLY WASN'T A DEFICIT 
THAT AUTOMATICALLY MEANT NO ONE WAS DEALING WITH THE QUESTION AS SERIOUS ADULTS REPRESENTING EQUALLY SERIOUS CONSTITUENTS

THE BANKS THAT OWNED SCANDINAVIAN BANK HAD TO INJECT ABOUT FORTY SEVEN POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL

FOR EXAMPLE EXERCISE 
THE OLDER PERSON WHO FEELS THAT HE IS JUST WAITING FOR THE END LIKELY WON'T BE MOTIVATED TO GET OUT AND BE ACTIVE 
BUT SCIENCE STILL IS COUNTING THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE 
INDEED MANY OF THE MALADIES OF AGING CAN BE REVERSED AS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS THE LOSS OF BONE STRENGTH THAT PARTICULARLY PLAGUES OLDER WOMEN 
STUDIES SHOW A GAIN IN BONE MASS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE IN EXERCISE PROGRAMS 
A YEAR EARLIER G. M. HUGHES HAD FIRST QUARTER PROFIT OF ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OR SEVENTY SEVEN CENTS A SHARE 
PER SHARE EARNINGS FOR THE NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX QUARTERS BENEFITED FROM THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION IN EACH PERIOD 
THE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT ABOVE BOOK VALUE THAT G. M. PAID FOR HUGHES AIRCRAFT 
THAT ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS A CHARGE AGAINST G. M.'S EARNINGS 
LORIMAR TELEPICTURES FELL ONE AND ONE QUARTER TO SIXTEEN 
THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A BUYBACK PROGRAM FOR AS MUCH AS FIFTEEN PERCENT OF COMMON SHARES AND A RESTRUCTURING TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES 
BUT THE COMPANY ALSO SAID IT WILL RECORD A LOSS OF FIFTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE YEAR ENDED MARCH THIRTY FIRST 
THOSE CREDITORS INCLUDE MULTILATERAL AGENCIES LATIN AMERICAN AND SOME EUROPEAN GOVERNMENTS AND SHORT TERM COMMERCIAL BANK CREDITORS AND SUPPLIERS 
PERU RECENTLY RESUMED DEBT PAYMENTS TO THE INTER AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 
BUT THERE AREN'T ANY CURRENT PLANS TO RESUME PAYMENTS TO THE WORLD BANK OR THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE ADVISER SAID 
SHARON'S BOARD FOUGHT THE ACQUISITION VIGOROUSLY TO NO AVAIL 
EVENTUALLY SHARON SHAREHOLDERS TENDERED EIGHTY SIX PERCENT OF THEIR SHARES GIVING N. V. F. CONTROL 
AT THE FIRST BOARD MEETING UNDER MR. POSNER SIX DIRECTORS RESIGN 
AN EMBITTERED MR. PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER 
WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT <UNK> 
IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE 
IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE 
MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS 
BONDS IN TURN SEEMED TO BE REACTING TO A DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR OFF ITS HIGHS EARLY IN THE DAY 
THE DOLLAR NEVERTHELESS SHOWED A GAIN FOR THE DAY AGAINST BOTH THE YEN AND THE WEST GERMAN MARK 
THE CONVERTIBLE FEATURE IN THE BONDS WAS AT THE COMPANY'S OPTION 
IF THE STOCK PROSPERED THE BONDHOLDERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPTION OF CASHING IN AND TAKING THE GAIN 
NO ONE HAS SUGGESTED ROGERS WAS ABOUT TO GO BANKRUPT AND DEFAULT ON ITS BONDS THE ONLY WAY THE INTEREST COULD BE JEOPARDIZED 
SO WHEN MR. GINSBURG FILED HIS BRIEF HE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE OR GAIN FROM ITS EFFECTS ON ROGERS'S FORTUNES 
ART COLLECTORS AND DEALERS HEAVED A SIGH OF RELIEF LAST <UNK> 
AFTER HIGH PRICES AND FRANTIC BIDDING AT ART AUCTIONS LAST SPRING ABOUT ONE IN FOUR WORKS DIDN'T SELL AT A CONTEMPORARY ART AUCTION AT CHRISTIE'S 
BUT AT LEAST THE MARKET DIDN'T CRASH 
HE HELPED US TO LOOK AT THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS SAYS ALFRED S. WARREN THE G. M. VICE PRESIDENT LEADING THE NEGOTIATIONS UNDER MR. JOHNSON 
HE WAS VERY REFRESHING IN SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS AND IDEAS 
BUT THE IDEAS NEVER BECAME REALITY 
G. M. EVENTUALLY SIGNED A TRADITIONAL PACT PATTERNED CLOSELY AFTER FORD'S 
YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU 
IF THEY'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SHOW US WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT IT 
THEY KNOW WHERE TO FIND US SAID ONE SOURCE 
WE'RE NOT STONEWALLING THEM 
ALTHOUGH MY TENTH MOVE HAD SET A STANDARD TRAP THREATENING TO WIN HIS KING PAWN MR. KASPAROV HAD TAKEN COUNTERMEASURES 
IT IS SOON APPARENT THAT I AM PRESENTING HIM WITH NO DIFFICULTIES MEANWHILE HE CONTROLS MORE SQUARES 
WHILE HE IS TAKING LONG THINKS OFTEN MORE THAN ONE MINUTE AGAINST MR. BONIN HE USUALLY MOVES INSTANTLY AGAINST ME 
MY ERRONEOUS QUEEN MANEUVER SENDS THE CHAMPION INTO HIS FIRST LONG STARE AT MY BOARD 
HE'S REALLY TAKING THIS VERY SERIOUSLY HE'S TRYING VERY HARD COMMENTS A SPECTATOR INTERNATIONAL MASTER NORMAN WEINSTEIN 
BUT I FIND IT HARD TO CONCENTRATE I AM GETTING INTERESTED IN THE BONIN GAME 
MANILA WITHIN NINE MONTHS JAIME ONGPIN WOULD BE DRIVEN BY DESPAIR TO KILL HIMSELF PENNING A NOTE TO HIS FAMILY I BEG YOUR FORGIVENESS 
BUT IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HE ARRIVED FOR DEBT TALKS IN MANHATTAN IN GOOD SPIRITS 
HOPING TO TRANSFORM THE STATIST PHILIPPINES INTO ASIA'S NEXT TIGER ECONOMY HE SERENADED HIS NEGOTIATING TEAM WITH THE OLD MELODY WE'RE ALMOST THERE 
ALTHOUGH INFLATION HAS SLOWED INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC DEMAND ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE A WIDELY PREDICTED DEEP RECESSION HAS BEEN AVOIDED 
INDEED A POWERFUL EXPORT BOOM ILLUSTRATING ONCE AGAIN THAT BRAZILIAN INDUSTRY IS GEARED TO SELL ABROAD AND ADJUST RAPIDLY IS FUELING A MILD RECOVERY 
IF INFLATION DOESN'T GO ANY HIGHER ANALYSTS BELIEVE THIS COULD BE MAINTAINED 
THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL 
BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THE THIRD WORLD DEBTORS 
THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES 
SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
THIRD NEW LOANS SHOULD BE MADE TO THE DEBTOR NATIONS BY THE BANKS THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND THE WORLD BANK AND EXPORT CREDIT AGENCIES 
MR. LLOYD SAYS HE HAS STARTED SELLING OFF HIS HOLDINGS TOO IN LINE WITH A FAMILY DECISION SIX MONTHS AGO 
BUT DON'T THINK FOR A MINUTE THAT HE'S LOSING INTEREST 
A FEW MONTHS AGO HE HAPPENED UPON SOME MEN FILLING A CAR TRUNK WITH HIS GRAPEFRUIT 
THE MEN WERE UNDETERRED BY HIS GRANDFATHERLY LOOKS 
SO HE REACHED INTO HIS CAR FOR HIS GUN AND TOLD THEM TO GET LOST 
MS. SAVITCH WAS HYPER AMBITIOUS TROUBLED AND UNPOPULAR 
SHE HAD CHARM IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA AN EXPERTLY CRAFTED FACADE BUT INSIDE SHE WAS IN TURMOIL 
SHE MIGHT HAVE HAD THE PEACE IN DEATH THAT SHE DIDN'T HAVE IN LIFE BUT FOR THIS BOOK AND ANOTHER ONE ABOUT HER DUE OUT SOON 
NOW STUNG BY THE RECENT DEBT LADEN TAKEOVERS SOME FUND MANAGERS ARE PLANNING TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL BONDS 
OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM 
WHAT MANY ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT 
OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT 
A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION 
IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY 
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE 
NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE 
BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT 
MR. YEUTTER MEANWHILE SAID THE U. S. IS STILL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THE E. C.'S CALL FOR A REBALANCING OF TARIFFS ON FARM PRODUCTS 
IN EXCHANGE FOR ACCEPTING SOME TARIFF REDUCTIONS THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY ENTER THE E. C. DUTY FREE 
THESE INCLUDE MAJOR U. S. EXPORTS TO THE E. C. SUCH AS SOYBEANS AND CORN GLUTEN

SOME ISSUERS ALSO ARE WARY OF DOING AWAY WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL 
IN WASHINGTON STATE A PROPOSAL TO USE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AS COUNSEL ON ALL STATE BOND ISSUES CAME BEFORE A LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR 
ITS ADOPTION WOULD HAVE SAVED WASHINGTON MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR 
STRONG OPPOSITION FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE DEFEATED THE PROPOSAL HOWEVER

MR. WEINBERGER IS NOT ALONE IN THIS REASONING 
THE DEFENSE PERCENTAGE OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT ARGUMENT WHICH APPARENTLY FIRST APPEARED IN THE MID NINETEEN SEVENTIES HAS TAKEN ON A LIFE OF ITS OWN 
IT IS NOW SO WIDELY ACCEPTED AS A MEASURE THAT IT'S BECOME A PERENNIAL COMPONENT OF THE BUDGET DEBATE 
INDEED THAT DEBATE HAS INCREASINGLY FEATURED STATISTICS ABOUT THE PERCENT OF G. N. P. BEING SPENT ON EDUCATION HEALTH AND OTHER GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS 
IT HAS BEEN SHOWN REPEATEDLY THAT THE PUBLIC SUPPORTS THE BASIC IDEA OF DEFENDING THE U. S. FROM INCOMING BALLISTIC MISSILES 
IF MR. REAGAN WANTS S. D. I. TO BE A LASTING LEGACY OF HIS ADMINISTRATION IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO START BUILDING ON THE SUPPORT THAT ALREADY EXISTS 
THAT TASK WILL BE MADE EASIER IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROVIDES THE DEVELOPING EVIDENCE OF THE SOVIET THREAT 
ALTHOUGH THE ANTI FRAUD PROVISIONS OF FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS APPLY TO MUNICIPALS OFFERINGS REGULATION OF THE MARKET IS LARGELY LEFT TO STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS 
SOME STATES LIKE NEW JERSEY REQUIRE THE FILING OF FINANCIAL REPORTS BY MUNICIPAL ISSUERS WITH THE SECRETARY OF STATE MR. TAYLOR NOTES 
OTHERS HAVE LITTLE OR NO SUPERVISION OF THE LOCAL UNITS 
PARTS THE SECOND AND THE THIRD ARE FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE SOME INTEREST THAT MAY NOT BE DEDUCTIBLE

A SPOKESMAN FOR CRAY DESCRIBED THE M. I. T. DECISION AS GOOD NEWS

BUT WHILE NICKEL AND ESPECIALLY COPPER QUOTES HAVE SINCE REBOUNDED ALUMINUM PRICES HAVE CONTINUED TO TUMBLE

BUT IT WILL OUTLIVE HER RACY FICTION WITH ITS FICKLE READERS 
PUBLISHERS WILL DUMP MOST OF THIS YEAR'S BEST SELLERS ON REMAINDER TABLES NEXT YEAR WHERE THEY MAY FETCH AS LITTLE AS ONE DOLLAR APIECE 
IN A UNANIMOUS RULING THE JUSTICES UPHELD A FEDERAL LAW ALLOWING RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ENGAGED IN NONPROFIT ACTIVITIES TO LIMIT HIRING TO PEOPLE OF THEIR OWN FAITH 
THE COURT RULED THAT THE CONSTITUTION ISN'T VIOLATED BY EXEMPTING SUCH GROUPS FROM THE FEDERAL LAW THAT BARS BIAS IN EMPLOYMENT BASED ON RELIGION 
THE DECISION GIVES RELIGIOUS GROUPS THE FLEXIBILITY TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN HIRING CRITERIA 
THE COMPANY SAID IT HAS IDENTIFIED SEVENTY TWO VEHICLES DAMAGED DURING TESTING 
THIRTY TWO OF THOSE WERE SCRAPPED OR SOLD AS USED 
BUT FORTY WERE REPAIRED AND SOLD AS NEW EVEN THOUGH REPAIRS IN ONE CASE TOTALED NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS 
THESE VEHICLES WILL BE REPLACED WITH NEW CHRYSLER MODELS 
THE COMPANY SAID IT IS NOTIFYING DEALERS AND OWNERS PARTLY THROUGH A BIG ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IT PLANS TO KICK OFF TODAY 
WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WORKED 
IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE 
IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE 
YESTERDAY THE AGENCY REVERSED THE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR FINDING THAT MEREDITH HAD VIOLATED THE DOCTRINE 
THE SO CALLED FAIRNESS DOCTRINE IS A MISNOMER SAID DIANE KILLORY THE AGENCY'S GENERAL COUNSEL 
IT PROMOTES BLANDNESS AND NOTHINGNESS BY CHILLING THE VERY SPEECH IT WAS MEANT TO FOSTER 
SENATOR EXON HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST OUTSPOKEN PROPONENTS OF BLOCKING CERTAIN FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
WHEN FUJITSU ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO TAKE OVER FAIRCHILD SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION LAST YEAR HE WAS QUICK TO COMPLAIN 
FAIRCHILD ACCOUNTS FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF U. S. SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTION AND WAS ALREADY CONTROLLED BY SCHLUMBERGER CORPORATION A LARGELY FRENCH OWNED FIRM 
NEVERTHELESS SENATOR EXON SAID THAT THE MERGER WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE NATIONAL SECURITY 
NEVERTHELESS FIRST OPTIONS STILL LETS CUSTOMERS SUCH AS JAMES F. HART TRADE IN NAKED OUT OF THE MONEY PUTS AND CALLS 
MR. HART SAYS FIRST OPTIONS HASN'T SOUGHT TO REIN HIM IN 
OTHER BROKERAGE FIRMS HOWEVER HAVE CURBED OR HALTED UNHEDGED OPTIONS TRADING SINCE THE CRASH 
THE SITUATION APPEARS TO PUT THE BOARD IN A TOUGH SPOT 
IT WAS NEVER ABLE TO COME UP WITH A FAIRNESS OPINION ON THE ORIGINAL OFFER 
IT SAID IT COULDN'T RECOMMEND WHETHER THE COMPANY SHOULD BE SOLD AT THAT TIME OR AT WHAT PRICE 
YESTERDAY CHARTER SAID ITS SPECIAL BOARD COMMITTEE HAD INFORMED THE GROUP THAT IT HASN'T DETERMINED WHETHER IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SELL THE COMPANY NOW EITHER 
THE REVISED OFFER IS SUBJECT TO THE COMMITTEE'S DETERMINING THAT THE PRICE IS FAIR AMONG OTHER CONDITIONS 
WE SAW IT WITH OIL AND WE'RE SEEING IT WITH GOLD SAYS JOHN DESSAUER AN ORLEANS MASSACHUSETTS MONEY MANAGER 
WHEN THE PRICE GETS HIGH ENOUGH ALL THESE NEW RESERVES OPEN UP EVENTUALLY KNOCKING DOWN PRICES HE SAYS 
HE ADDS THAT HE EXPECTS GOLD WILL SOON RETREAT TO BELOW FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS 
THE OTHER EUROPEAN MARKETS ALSO POSTED DECLINES 
STOCKS CLOSED LOWER IN PARIS ZURICH BRUSSELS AMSTERDAM STOCKHOLM AND MILAN 
JOINING THE CROWD WERE SHARE PRICES IN SYDNEY WELLINGTON TAIPEI MANILA HONG KONG AND SINGAPORE 
ADVANCING ISSUES AND DECLINERS WERE NECK AND NECK YESTERDAY BUT THE HEAVIEST TRADING WAS AMONG THE ISSUES WITH RISING PRICES 
SOME FIFTY POINT FOUR MILLION SHARES CHANGED HANDS AT ADVANCING PRICES COMPARED WITH THIRTY FIVE POINT SIX MILLION THAT TRADED AT LOWER PRICES 
IN ALL A MODERATE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION SHARES TRADED ON NASDAQ YESTERDAY 
JIM POYNER AN ANALYST WITH RAUSCHER PIERCE REFSNES INCORPORATED IN DALLAS SAID THEY THE GROUP MAY RUN INTO SOME RESISTANCE FROM OUTSIDE SHAREHOLDERS 
THE COMPANY IS WORTH AT LEAST A FEW DOLLARS PER SHARE MORE THAN THIS 
I THINK IF ANOTHER COMPANY WERE TRYING TO BUY STERLING THEY'D HAVE TO PAY MORE THAN THIS 
AMERICAN STANDARD SAID IT IS VERY PLEASED BY BLACK AND DECKER'S WITHDRAWAL 
IT DECLINED TO ELABORATE 
IF BLACK AND DECKER SHOULD RESUME ITS PURSUIT SOURCES CLOSE TO AMERICAN STANDARD SAID THE COMPANY IS PREPARED TO RESIST AGAIN 
WHILE CAMPBELL IS CONFIDENT ITS MICROWAVE BREAKTHROUGH WILL LURE NEW CONSUMERS WHO HAVE NEVER BEFORE SAMPLED A FROZEN BREAKFAST OTHER COMPETITORS ARE WAFFLING 
WE HAVE LOOKED AT THEM MICROWAVE WAFFLES SAID A SPOKESMAN AT I. C. INDUSTRIES 
BUT OUR FEELING IS THAT THE TOASTER WAFFLES THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE IN THIRTY SECONDS ARE MORE CONVENIENT AND BETTER QUALITY 
BUT AT ANOTHER OPERATION IN RURAL NORTHERN ILLINOIS THERE ARE HARDLY ANY MINORITIES TO DRAW FROM 
WE PICKED THAT LOCATION BECAUSE WE NEEDED THE RIVER ACCESS THERE TO BE SUCCESSFUL MR. THOMPSON SAYS 
I KNOW I HAVE A SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY 
BUT I ALSO HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MY SHAREHOLDERS 
THE LAST STUMBLING BLOCK FOR THE BILL WAS SENATOR BRADLEY'S EFFORT TO ADD THE HOME CARE PROVISION 
AT FIRST SECRETARY BOWEN OPPOSED THE PROVISION BUT LAWMAKERS NARROWED THE BENEFIT AND LIMITED ITS COST 
THESE EFFORTS WON OVER THE REAGAN OFFICIAL WHO HAS CHAMPIONED THE LEGISLATION 
BOTH STAPLES AND OFFICE CLUB HOPE TO BE ABLE TO GO PUBLIC NEXT YEAR 
THEY AREN'T AFRAID OF LARGE DISCOUNTERS SUCH AS K. MART AND AMES 
MR. PEARLMAN THE PORTFOLIO MANAGER SAYS HISTORY HASN'T SHOWN THAT BIG RETAILERS HAVE BEEN GOOD AT SPECIALTY RETAILING 
MR. VIET HAS BIGGER WORRIES 
APART FROM UNCOOPERATIVE TARGETS THE PAPER AND ITS THIRTY TWO JOURNALISTS FACE A CHALLENGE TO BECOME MORE PROFESSIONAL HE SAYS 
CRITICIZING SHORTCOMINGS ISN'T ENOUGH 
WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE ACHIEVEMENTS 
WE HAVE TO DEVELOP JUDGMENT AND THAT ISN'T EASY 
IF THE SETTLEMENT IS COMPLETED THE COMPANY WOULD JOIN SHAREHOLDER PLAINTIFFS IN SEEKING DAMAGES AGAINST FOUNDER EDDIE ANTAR AND OTHERS 
CRAZY EDDIE CURRENTLY IS A DEFENDANT IN THE HOLDERS' LITIGATION 
THE NEW MANAGEMENT HAS ACCUSED MR. ANTAR IN COURT AND REGULATORY FILINGS OF ENGAGING IN A POSSIBLE SCHEME TO FALSIFY INVENTORY AND PROFIT REPORTS 
INDEED NO CHANGES ARE LIKELY SOON BECAUSE THE WHOLESALERS AND SMALL RETAILERS THAT BENEFIT FROM THE EXISTING SYSTEM ARE WELL ORGANIZED BACKERS OF THE RULING LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
THE JAPANESE DEBATE ON THE DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM BEGAN ONLY RECENTLY 
EVEN AFTER A CONSENSUS IS REACHED NEW LEGISLATION MAY HAVE TO BE DRAFTED AND ENACTED 
SHE SAID THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE NEW MODEL TO EXPAND THE MARKET RATHER THAN CANNIBALIZE SALES OF CONVENTIONAL MODELS 
THE SOUTH SAN FRANCISCO CALIFORNIA COMPANY DECLINED TO PROJECT SALES FOR THE NEW MODEL 
IN AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY DIASONICS SHARES CLOSED UNCHANGED AT TWO POINT EIGHT SEVEN FIVE DOLLARS 
IN BETWEEN THE PURCHASERS' REPORT AND THE JOBS DATA THE GOVERNMENT WILL RELEASE A HALF DOZEN OTHER SERIES INCLUDING JUNE'S LEADING ECONOMIC INDICATORS INDEX 
THAT INDEX COULD ADD TO RECESSION FEARS IF IT DECLINES AS EXPECTED 
A DROP IN THE GOVERNMENT'S CHIEF ECONOMIC FORECASTING TOOL WOULD MARK THE FOURTH DECLINE IN FIVE MONTHS 
A RULE OF THUMB AMONG ECONOMISTS HOLDS THAT THREE SUCCESSIVE DECLINES IN THE INDEX SIGNAL RECESSION 
WE ARE EXTREMELY SELECTIVE SAID PAUL SUCKOW DIRECTOR OF FIXED INCOME AT OPPENHEIMER MANAGEMENT CORPORATION 
I DON'T THINK SOME ISSUES ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HE SAID 
EVEN CAUTIOUS MANAGERS SUCH AS MR. SUCKOW ARE SEEING THE IMPACT OF THE CAMPEAU DEBACLE 
HE SAID HIS FIRM OWNS A SMALL AMOUNT OF THE FEDERATED SENIOR DEBT 
ALTHOUGH THE BONDS ARE SECURED BY BANK CREDITS THEY HAVE ALSO FALLEN IN PRICE RECENTLY

BUT MR. MORRIS INDICATED THAT THE NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE'S INTERESTS APPEARED TO BE ELSEWHERE

THE FOLLOWING LETTER HAS BEEN SIGNED BY ONE THOUSAND CHINESE CITIZENS WHO ARE STUDYING IN THE U. S. 
MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY HAVE ALLOWED THEIR NAMES TO BE PUBLISHED IN THE U. S. CHINESE LANGUAGE PRESS THE REST HAVE REQUESTED ANONYMITY 
A COPY OF THE DOCUMENT HAS BEEN DELIVERED TO THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
LAST OCTOBER SIX HUNDRED OF ITS ONE THOUSAND WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE AFTER THEIR CONTRACT EXPIRED 
THE PLANTS CONTINUED TO OPERATE AT REDUCED CAPACITY DURING THE STRIKE AND A SPOKESMAN FOR THE COMPANY SAID ALL WORKERS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN WITHIN A WEEK 
DETAILS OF THE AGREEMENT WEREN'T DISCLOSED BUT THE SPOKESMAN SAID IT OFFERED MODEST WAGE INCREASES 
BUYING CORPORATE ZEROS FOR AN I. R. A. NEUTRALIZES THEIR MOST OBVIOUS DISADVANTAGE THE TAX TREATMENT 
WITH RARE EXCEPTIONS SUCH BONDS TRIGGER PERSONAL INCOME TAX EACH YEAR ON THE THEORETICAL ACCUMULATION OR ACCRETION OF INTEREST 
THAT MEANS INVESTORS PAY TAX ON MONEY THEY HAVEN'T YET RECEIVED 
!NOISE IF THE BONDS ARE BOUGHT FOR AN I. R. A. HOWEVER NO TAX IS DUE UNTIL THE MONEY IS WITHDRAWN 
THAT MAY SIGNAL THAT EQUITY LINKED EUROBONDS AREN'T GOING TO DISAPPEAR EVEN IF EQUITIES FALL OUT OF INVESTOR FAVOR 
DIFFICULT MARKETS WON'T END THE GAME SAYS A SYNDICATION OFFICIAL FOR ONE LARGE U. S. INVESTMENT HOUSE 
WE'LL JUST ADAPT THE PRODUCT 
IT WAS A WONDERFUL DAY FOR THE BOND MARKETS SAID MICHAEL J. CONNERY THE SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF FINANCIAL FUTURES AT CHICAGO BASED REFCO INCORPORATED 
ALL THE APPARENT SIGNS OF INFLATION WERE DEFLATED 
AND THAT'S LED TO A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF SHORT COVERING OR TRADERS AND INVESTORS BUYING BACK SECURITIES THAT THEY BORROWED AND SOLD 
WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT IN IRAN IT IS AMONG THE PLANET'S MOST VITAL TERRITORIES 
OUR SHARED ENEMY HAS FIVE DIVISIONS IN IRAN'S NORTHERN BORDER 
THIS LOOMING SOVIET PRESENCE THREATENS NOT JUST AFGHANISTAN SOUTH OF THE SOVIET UNION AND EAST OF IRAN BUT THE PERSIAN GULF 
THE WARM WATER PORT THE CZARS DREAMED OF IS WITHIN REACH 
WE WILL HAVE A LOT MORE THAN KUWAITI TANKERS TO WORRY ABOUT IF THE SOVIETS GET THEIR PAWS ON THE OIL SPIGOT OF WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN 
IN SHORT THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE AYATOLLAH WAS BAD NEWS FOR THE WEST THE FALL OF IRAN TO THE SOVIETS WOULD BE UNTHINKABLE 
AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED THE INVESTIGATION OF MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT HAS LED TO AN UNPRECEDENTED EXAMINATION OF THE LARGELY UNREGULATED SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET 
THIS IN TURN HAS LED TO CALLS FROM FINANCIERS AND POLITICIANS FOR CLOSER REGULATION OF THIS HUGE MARKET 
THE INVESTIGATION CENTERS ON WHETHER BOND ISSUES SOLD AS TAX EXEMPT BY MATTHEWS AND WRIGHT AND OTHER UNDERWRITERS ACTUALLY WARRANT TAX EXEMPT STATUS 
INVESTORS RANGING FROM U. S. CORPORATIONS TO JAPANESE BUYERS OF U. S. T. BILLS MUST FACTOR IN A RISK PREMIUM FOR DOLLAR VOLATILITY 
THUS IT IS AT LEAST PLAUSIBLE IF NOT LIKELY THAT DOLLAR VOLATILITY IS ONE REASON REAL INTEREST RATES HAVE STAYED HIGH IN THE U. S. 
IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY 
ANOTHER REASON MR. SOIFER IS AVOIDING MORGAN AND CITICORP IS THAT THEIR STOCK PRICES AT TIMES HAVE TENDED TO GYRATE MORE VIOLENTLY THAN OTHER BANK ISSUES 
CITICORP AND MORGAN TEND TO HAVE MORE VOLATILITY ON DAYS WHEN PROGRAM TRADING IS KNOWN TO OCCUR MR. SOIFER SAYS 
THEY'RE MORE OF A BET ON WHICH WAY THE MARKET IS HEADED 
INEVITABLY SOME WILL SEEK A FOURTH ALTERNATIVE TO CONTINUE BORROWING FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD MAKING ONLY MARGINAL ADJUSTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICIES 
EARLIER THIS CENTURY THE BRITISH TAUGHT US THAT DEBT AND LEADERSHIP CANNOT LONG CO EXIST 
EVENTUALLY AND THE MARKETS SEEM TO BE SAYING SOONER RATHER THAN LATER WE WILL HAVE TO CHOOSE 
SOME MONTHS BEFORE THE CRASH INTEREST RATES STARTED TO MOVE UP 
HOME MORTGAGE RATES WENT UP ALMOST TEN TIMES AS FAST AS THEY CAME DOWN 
THE MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH WAS MUDDLING AT OR BELOW THE LOWER END OF THE TARGET RANGE A PHENOMENON WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED FOR MANY YEARS 
CAMPEAU BOOSTED ITS HOSTILE OFFER FOR FEDERATED DEPARTMENT STORES TO FIVE POINT FOUR SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS AMID SIGNS OF A POSSIBLE BIDDING WAR FOR THE RETAILER 
AT LEAST TWO MAJOR GROUPS ARE WEIGHING BIDS SOURCES SAID INCLUDING A GROUP LED BY KOHLBERG KRAVIS 
OTHER POTENTIAL SUITORS ARE SAID TO BE DILLARD DEPARTMENT STORES AND THE DEVELOPERS ALFRED TAUBMAN AND MELVIN SIMON 
PILLSBURY'S LOSS COMPARES WITH EARNINGS OF FORTY EIGHT POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS OR FIFTY SIX CENTS A SHARE IN THE YEAR EARLIER QUARTER 
REVENUE FELL TWO PERCENT IN THE LATEST PERIOD TO ONE POINT FIVE OH BILLION DOLLARS FROM ONE POINT FIVE THREE BILLION DOLLARS 
THE REVENUE DECLINE CAME FROM PILLSBURY'S RESTAURANT BUSINESS 
AND THE AGREEMENT COMES AT A TIME WHEN THE NUMBER OF BEEF CATTLE IN THE NATION IS AT A TWENTY EIGHT YEAR LOW 
CATTLEMEN HAVE BEEN CUTTING DOWN THEIR HERDS IN RESPONSE TO LOWER PRICES 
WHILE PRICES BEGAN TO RISE THIS YEAR THE DROUGHT AND BANKERS' EAGERNESS TO HAVE FARM LOANS REPAID HAVE DELAYED ANY REBUILDING OF HERDS 
I DON'T THINK ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE JAPANESE AGREEMENT WILL AFFECT THAT A WHOLE LOT SAID JACK DAHL A LARGE NORTH DAKOTA RANCHER 
STANFORD NOW CHOOSES NOT TO REQUIRE ITS UNDERGRADUATES TO STUDY THEIR WESTERN HERITAGE BUT THAT HISTORY DOES YIELD CERTAIN LESSONS 
ONE OF THEM IS THAT MINORITIES THAT DO NOT RESPOND EFFECTIVELY TO ATTACKS FROM THE MAJORITY MERELY ENCOURAGE FURTHER ASSAULTS 
PERHAPS THE HOOVER OVERSEERS SHOULD KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN THEY PONDER THE LATEST AFFRONT TO GLENN CAMPBELL NEXT WEEK 
SENATORIAL PRIVILEGE HAS SOLD MORE THAN SEVENTY THOUSAND COPIES DESPITE THIS MAJOR MEDIA NEGLECT OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF IT 
MR. DAMORE HAS GONE HAWKING THE BOOK IN THAT PARALLEL UNIVERSE OF POPULIST MEDIA OUTLETS 
THE BOOK GOT ITS FIRST BIG PUSH FROM A SEGMENT ON A CURRENT AFFAIR THE FOX NETWORK'S TELEVISION TABLOID 
MR. DAMORE HAS DONE MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED INTERVIEWS ON TALK RADIO STATIONS 
BANCORP HAWAII ALSO DECLARED A THREE FOR TWO STOCK SPLIT PAYABLE NOVEMBER SIXTEENTH TO STOCK OF RECORD OCTOBER TWENTY FOURTH 
THE STOCK SPLIT WILL INCREASE THE COMPANY'S SHARES OUTSTANDING TO FOURTEEN POINT FIVE MILLION FROM NINE POINT SEVEN MILLION 
A COMPANY OFFICIAL SAID THE DOLLAR A SHARE DIVIDEND WILL BE PAID ON SHARES OUTSTANDING PRIOR TO THE STOCK SPLIT 
INVESTORS ALSO PREFER REMICS BACKED BY SWAP TEN PERCENT SECURITIES BECAUSE PREPAYMENTS ARE LESS VOLATILE 
FREDDIE MAC PASSES THROUGH ACTUAL PREPAYMENTS ON SWAP MORTGAGE ISSUES WHILE IT ESTIMATES PREPAYMENTS ON THE CASH ISSUES 
PREPAYMENTS ON FREDDIE MAC CASH ISSUES ARE MUCH MORE VOLATILE FROM MONTH TO MONTH THAN PREPAYMENTS ON THE SWAP ISSUES 
CHICAGO BASED J. M. B.'S FORTY NINE DOLLAR A SHARE BID FOR AMFAC HAS A TOTAL VALUE OF ABOUT NINE HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHERE THE AUCTIONS ARE GOING IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IN TOKYO SAID MR. PETRI OF MERRILL LYNCH 
NO ONE FIRM CAN DOMINATE THE AUCTION PROCESS THE WAY SALOMON USED TO 
THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE JAPANESE INFLUENCE 
THE SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE FOR CINDERELLA IS TWENTY SIX DOLLARS AND NINETY NINE CENTS AND FOR E. T. TWENTY FOUR DOLLARS AND NINETY FIVE CENTS 
BUT BOTH HAVE BEEN HEAVILY DISCOUNTED BY AS MUCH AS NINE DOLLARS A CASSETTE AND BOTH HAVE REBATE OFFERS 
THE HOME VIDEO INDUSTRY IS HOPING THE MASSIVE PURCHASES OF BOTH CASSETTES WILL TURN MANY CASSETTE RENTERS INTO AT LEAST OCCASIONAL BUYERS IN THE FUTURE 
DURING THAT CAMPAIGN AS IN EARLIER ONES A FEW LOW AND MIDDLE RANKING OFFICIALS WERE ARRESTED OR DISMISSED 
BUT NO LEADING CADRES OR THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS WERE PUNISHED FUELING CYNICISM AMONG THE MASSES 
AND THE <UNK> CORRUPTION PROBLEM SEEMED ONLY TO GET WORSE

THAT'S WORTH MONEY 
IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE THE COMPANY HAS DOUBLED ITS PROFITS AND TRIPLED ITS STAFF HE ADDS 
SALES ARE STILL UNDER TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR HE SAYS BUT THEY'RE HEADED UP 
THE SINHALESE COMMUNITY ALSO HAS BEEN DRIVEN TO SELF DEFENSE 
CONTRARY TO A VIEW FASHIONABLE IN MANY CIRCLES OF THE COLOMBO ELITE THE J. V. P. HAS NOT CAUSED THE PRESENT INSURGENCY 
NEITHER CAN IT EVEN BE SAID TO BE LEADING IT IT IS RACING TO KEEP UP WITH IT

PAYOFFS TO MOSCOW BY THE WEST COULD RANGE FROM SOFTENING HUMAN RIGHTS POLICIES TO EXTENDING CHEAP LOANS TO RELAXING TECHNOLOGY CONTROLS

PEOPLE CAN SAY WHAT THEY WANT BUT WE DON'T COMMENT HE SAID 
MR. WALTER HIMSELF AND OTHER TOP EXECUTIVES DIDN'T RETURN PHONE CALLS 
HE ALSO RELIED HEAVILY ON ADVERTISING RATHER THAN ON DIRECT MAILING WHICH IS BY FAR THE MOST COMMON WAY FOR NEWSLETTER PUBLISHERS TO SOLICIT SUBSCRIBERS 
THIS UNUSUAL STRATEGY EVOLVED FROM A SMALL AD PLACED IN A BUSINESS MAGAZINE 
THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR AD GENERATED ENOUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS TO PAY FOR ITSELF IN A WEEK SO MR. KOBREN BEGAN ADVERTISING IN OTHER PUBLICATIONS

THE HUGE GAP TO A LARGE EXTENT IS A PRICE PHENOMENON 
THE DOLLAR'S FALL HAS PUSHED UP THE PRICE OF IMPORTS CAUSING THE DEFICIT TO SWELL EVEN AS THE VOLUME OF NON OIL IMPORTS HAS RECEDED

WHEN A MAJOR NATIONAL RETAILER WENT THROUGH A COST CUTTING PERIOD A NUMBER OF OLDER EXECUTIVES WERE DISCHARGED AT THE SAME TIME AS THE CONSOLIDATION OF DEPARTMENTS 
THESE EXECUTIVES BANDED TOGETHER AND INSTITUTED A CLASS ACTION SUIT AGAINST THE FORMER EMPLOYER

MAYBE YOU SHOULD HAVE A VARIETY OF HOLDINGS IN YOUR PORTFOLIO 
OR PERHAPS YOU SHOULD LIMIT YOUR EXPOSURE BY HEDGING 
YOU COULD MAKE A PLAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS DEAL I SUGGESTED EARNESTLY 
THOUGH THERE ISN'T A CURE FOR AIDS PROPONENTS ARGUE THAT THOSE WHO TEST POSITIVE CAN BE OFFERED TREATMENTS TO PROLONG THEIR LIVES 
FOR INSTANCE THEY CAN TAKE MEDICATION TO PREVENT CATCHING THE KIND OF PNEUMONIA THAT MOST COMMONLY LEADS TO THE DEATH OF AIDS SUFFERERS 
AND THOSE WHO HAVE NOT YET DEVELOPED AIDS CAN TAKE STEPS TO GUARD AGAINST OTHER DISEASES SUCH AS HERPES AND HEPATITIS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO ACCELERATE ITS ONSET 
WHILE THE U. S. FOCUSES ON THE IRAN CONTRA HEARINGS MORE SOVIET ARMS FLOW INTO NICARAGUA 
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF WEAPONS WERE DELIVERED TO THE SANDINISTAS IN THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR ACCORDING TO U. S. INTELLIGENCE 
THAT'S ABOUT NINE TIMES THE DIRECT U. S. MILITARY AID PROVIDED TO THE CONTRAS IN THAT PERIOD 
THE SOVIET EQUIPMENT IS JUST POURING IN ONE RANKING PENTAGON OFFICIAL TOLD THE A. P. 
THE NICARAGUANS ARE CONSOLIDATING THEIR MILITARY BUILDUP AND ADDING TO IT EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE 
IN REACTION TO THE NEWS INTEREST RATES PLUNGED THE AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR FIRMED AND ANALYSTS PREDICTED STOCKS WOULD MOVE HIGHER

LONDON'S FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX ROSE THIRTEEN POINT FOUR TO ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX POINT NINE

A GOOD PLACE TO START IS THE NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT CAMPAIGN 
IN NEW YORK THE MARKET ROUT HAS PUT SELLERS UNDER MORE PRESSURE 
FOR EXAMPLE AN EXECUTIVE IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY RECENTLY TURNED DOWN A TWO MILLION DOLLAR OFFER ON HIS WEST SIDE COOPERATIVE APARTMENT AS BEING TOO LOW 
YESTERDAY HE HURRIEDLY CALLED HIS BROKER S. W. BIRD AND COMPANY TO SAY HE WOULD ACCEPT THE BID IF IT WAS STILL OFFERED 
BUT FOR MOST MUTUAL FUND INVESTORS THE TAX BITE THIS YEAR WILL BE BIGGER THAN EVER 
HOLDERS ARE TAXED ON ONE HUNDRED PERCENT OF REALIZED CAPITAL GAINS UNDER THE NEW TAX LAW FOR INSTANCE 
PREVIOUSLY SIXTY PERCENT WAS EXCLUDED FROM TAXATION 
ANY GAIN CREDITED TO INVESTORS BY THEIR FUND IS CONSIDERED REALIZED WHETHER THE HOLDER ACTUALLY SELLS ANY FUND SHARES OR NOT

BUT NATWEST THEN PUSHING TO DISLODGE BARCLAYS AS BRITAIN'S TOP COMMERCIAL BANK WAS MORE RELUCTANT TO COMMIT ITSELF TO A SIMILAR POSITION IN INVESTMENT BANKING

IT'S BUSINESS AS USUAL

THE MARKET HASN'T CHANGED CHARACTER 
SO FAR FROM A MARKET VIEWPOINT IT DOESN'T LOOK TO BE MUCH OF AN EVENT

IN FACT GIVEN THE HIGHLY DEVELOPED U. S. TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE FEW IF ANY SHIPPERS ARE TRULY CAPTIVE TO RAILS 
THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER 
FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS 
THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR 
IN DRAWING UP CONTRACTS THE RELEVANT FACT IS THAT BOTH THE RAILROAD AND THE UTILITY NEED EACH OTHER

THE UNCERTAINTY OVER THE OWNERSHIP ISSUE IS COMPLICATING AN ARRAY OF OTHER IMPORTANT DECISIONS INCLUDING THE FINANCING AND MANAGEMENT FOR WHATEVER COMPANY FINALLY EMERGES 
THE LEVEL OF LABOR OWNERSHIP AFFECTS THE AMOUNT OF FINANCING THE COMPANY WILL NEED AND POSSIBLY WHO PROVIDES IT 
IF THE LABOR GROUPS END UP WITH A CONTROLLING INTEREST THEY INTEND TO PICK THEIR OWN BOSSES 
ACCORDING TO THE AGREEMENT TOYOTA WILL SUPPLY V. W. WITH NECESSARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND PARTS FOR PRODUCTION 
LOCAL CONTENT IS TARGETED TO EXCEED FIFTY PERCENT BY THE END OF NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE BUT BOTH COMPANIES WILL TRY TO BOOST THAT RATIO EVEN FURTHER 
AT LEAST SIXTY PERCENT OF THE PARTS HAVE TO BE MADE WITHIN THE E. C. FOR MOTOR VEHICLES TO BE MARKETED IN THE REGION WITHOUT TARIFFS 
ANALYSTS ALSO SAID THEY HADN'T EXPECTED LOWER OPERATING PROFITS FOR THE COMPANY'S INDUSTRIES GROUP AND FOR THE BROADCASTING SEGMENT 
WESTINGHOUSE OFFICIALS TOLD ANALYSTS THAT OPERATING PROFIT IN THE INDUSTRIES GROUP FELL FIFTEEN PERCENT TO TWENTY PERCENT HURT IN PART BY WEAK RESULTS IN CANADIAN OPERATIONS 
A SHARP DROP IN OPERATING PROFIT FROM THE BROADCASTING GROUP'S PRODUCTION COMPANY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS OVERALL FOR THAT SEGMENT 
RESIDENTS HERE SAY ONE MIGHT EXPECT SUCH GOINGS ON IN MIAMI OR FORT LAUDERDALE BUT NOT IN SLEEPY WINTER HAVEN 
THE BIGGEST SCAM IN RECENT MEMORY WAS A RABBIT BREEDING SCHEME THAT LURED LOCALS INTO BUYING AND RAISING BUNNIES FOR PELTS IN THE LATE NINETEEN SEVENTIES 
NOW THEY ARE BRACING FOR THE AFTERSHOCKS OF S. H. OIL'S FALL 
BUT MANY CLUBS DON'T OFFER TEAM SPORTS AT ALL 
THIS REFLECTS A GERMANIC DISTASTE FOR THE IDEA OF COMPETITION AS A GOAL IN ITSELF AND FOR THE AMERICAN PENCHANT FOR TURNING PRACTICALLY EVERYTHING INTO A CONTEST 
BEAUTY PAGEANTS ARE RARE HERE HOSTILE TAKEOVERS ARE UNKNOWN IN THE BUSINESS WORLD AND THE GOVERNMENT STILL FIXES PRICES ON MANY PRODUCTS AND STRICTLY REGULATES STORE HOURS 
HE ALSO WAS EMPHATIC ABOUT KEEPING BURGER KING 
I WANT TO SAY WITHOUT QUALIFICATION THAT BURGER KING IS CENTRAL TO PILLSBURY 
IT WAS TRUE YESTERDAY IT IS TRUE TODAY AND IT REMAINS TRUE FOR THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC FUTURE HE SAID 
IN THE TWO SELECTED AREAS THE STATE WILL ALLOW PROCUREMENT AND RETAIL PRICES TO RISE TO WHAT THE OPEN MARKET DEMANDS 
THE SUBSIDY FOR CONSUMERS IS MEANT TO REDUCE THE STRAIN ON URBAN RESIDENTS 
FARMERS OF COURSE WILL GET HIGHER PRICES FOR THEIR GRAIN FROM THE MARKET WHICH IN TURN SHOULD INDUCE THEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTION 
GRAIN PRODUCTION THROUGHOUT CHINA HAS FALTERED IN RECENT YEARS IN PART BECAUSE STATE PROCUREMENT PRICES WERE TOO LOW 
THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT INVITES FOREIGN NEWSPAPERS TO PRINT THE TRUTH ABOUT SINGAPORE 
BUT WHY HAS THE ASIAN WALL STREET JOURNAL REFUSED TO PRINT GOVERNMENT REPLIES CORRECTING ERRORS AND BIASES IN ITS REPORTING 
WHY DOES IT DENY THE SINGAPORE GOVERNMENT THE SIMPLE RIGHT OF REPLY 
MEANWHILE AUDI SET UP A BONUS PLAN TO ENCOURAGE DEALERSHIP SALESPEOPLE TO SELL AUDI EIGHTY AND NINETY CARS NEWER MODELS THAT CARRY FAR LESS GENEROUS INCENTIVES 
UNDER THE BONUS PLAN AUDI PROMISED TO GIVE SALES PEOPLE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS EVERY TIME THEY SOLD AN EIGHTY OR NINETY MODEL 
LAW OFFICIALS FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE SAID THEY ARE OPENING INQUIRIES INTO AUDI'S REBATES 
COMPLETION OF THE TRANSACTION WHICH ALSO REQUIRES APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES AND HOLDERS OF OTHER SECURITIES MUST BE COMPLETED NO LATER THAN NOVEMBER THIRTIETH UNDER THE AGREEMENT 
IF IT DOESN'T CLOSE AS EXPECTED BY SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THE CASH PRICE PAID BY NOVA FOR EACH POLYSAR COMMON SHARE WOULD RISE TEN CANADIAN CENTS 
THE CASH PRICE WOULD RISE FIFTEEN MORE CENTS TO FOURTEEN CANADIAN DOLLARS AND SEVENTY FIVE CENTS A SHARE IF THE TRANSACTION CLOSES IN NOVEMBER THE SIDES SAID 
COMMISSION CHAIRMAN DENNIS PATRICK HOWEVER SAID HE THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES TO KEEP INDEPENDENT STATIONS ON CABLE SYSTEMS AS LONG AS THEY WERE POPULAR 
MR. PATRICK ALSO SAID THAT ONE ORIGINAL CONCERN THAT NETWORK OWNERSHIP MIGHT IMPEDE THE GROWTH OF CABLE AS A COMPETITOR OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T MATTER ANYMORE 
HOUSEHOLDS WITH CABLE T. V. HAVE INCREASED TO MORE THAN FORTY MILLION FROM ABOUT TEN MILLION IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX 
THE FIRM NEITHER WOULD DISCLOSE HOW MUCH MONEY IT EXPECTS TO SAVE NOR WOULD SAY HOW MANY LAYOFFS MIGHT RESULT 
IN SOME CASES WHERE PORTFOLIO MANAGERS WERE MANAGING MORE THAN ONE FUND THEY PROBABLY WILL STAY ON MR. GLASSMAN SAID 
BUT HE SAID NO FINAL DECISIONS HAD BEEN MADE 
BUT NOW THE COMPANY'S MARKETING ATTENTION IS SHIFTING COMPLETELY AWAY FROM THE SAMURAI IN FAVOR OF THE TWO NEW VEHICLES 
SUZUKI OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL SPEND ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING BY YEAR END TO LAUNCH THE SWIFT AND THE SIDEKICK 
BY APRIL SUZUKI EXPECTS TO SHIP TWENTY THOUSAND OF THE CARS AND THIRTY THOUSAND OF THE SPORT UTILITY VEHICLES TO THE U. S. 
BUT MR. MCCONNELL IN RESPONSE SAID HE BELIEVED THAT AT LEAST SEVEN THOUSAND UNITS HAD BEEN LOST SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY 
IN HIS EXPERIENCE OWNERS DO REGISTER UNITS EVEN IF THEY ARE EXEMPT FROM RENT CONTROL PRECISELY TO ESTABLISH THAT THEY ARE EXEMPT 
THOSE WHO WORK FOR THE RENT BOARD WILL TELL YOU THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OF HOUSING HE SAID 
EVERYBODY ELSE IN TOWN WILL TELL YOU OTHERWISE 
THIS PLAN DUBBED THE MIYAZAWA PLAN IN HONOR OF JAPANESE FINANCE MINISTER KIICHI MIYAZAWA SOUNDS JOLLY ON THE SURFACE 
BANKS WOULD HAVE A NEW MARKET AT THE I. M. F. WHERE THEY COULD PEDDLE UNWANTED DEBTOR NATION PAPER 
THE DEBTOR NATIONS WOULD HAVE A NEW SOURCE OF FINANCING OF SORTS 
THEY COULD RESCHEDULE A PORTION OF THEIR DEBTS WITH A POSSIBILITY UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OF REPAYING SOME IN THEIR OWN CURRENCIES 
THE I. M. F. WOULD HAVE A MORE CENTRAL ROLE IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INTERNATIONAL DEBT 
AND THE JAPANESE WOULD BECOME CLOSE PARTNERS OF THE I. M. F. IN DEBT MANAGEMENT 
AS MANY EMPLOYERS ARE THE BIG BROKER IS ENDING A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN THAT PROVIDED PENSIONS BASED ON SALARY AND YEARS OF SERVICE 
DEFINED BENEFITS HAVE BECOME COSTLIER TO ADMINISTER BECAUSE OF NEW TAX AND ACCOUNTING RULES 
AND EMPLOYEES TEND TO SEE A PENSION YEARS AWAY AS LESS VALUABLE THAN A PAYMENT HERE AND NOW 
ALL OF THIS HAS LED MORE FIRMS TO ADOPT DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN WHICH SALARY AND SERVICE DETERMINE ANNUAL PAYMENTS TO AN EMPLOYEE'S ACCOUNT 
THE BOND ISSUANCE PROVISION IS PART OF A CONTROVERSIAL TAX BILL 
AS OF LATE YESTERDAY THAT BILL APPEARED STALLED ANALYSTS SAID 
IF CONGRESS DOESN'T ACT SOON THE TREASURY WON'T BE ABLE TO ISSUE NEW LONG TERM BONDS UNTIL EARLY NEXT YEAR 
A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION 
IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY 
AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE 
NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON 
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE 
BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT

AT THE CARNEGIE ROCHESTER CONFERENCE IN PITTSBURGH EARLIER THIS MONTH BENNETT MCCALLUM OF CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY DISCUSSED A DIFFERENT RULE 
THE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT HAS GROWN AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF ABOUT THREE PERCENT FOR YEARS 
SO THE MONETARY AUTHORITY WOULD WANT TO SUPPLY ENOUGH BASE MONEY CURRENCY PLUS BANK RESERVES TO SUPPORT THAT GROWTH 
THE TARGET FOR GROWTH OF THE BASE WOULD BE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE BASE AND G. N. P. OVER THE PAST FOUR YEARS 
THERE WOULD ALSO BE A PROVISION TO ADJUST THE BASE WHEN G. N. P. DEPARTS FROM ITS TARGET PATH 
MR. MCCALLUM TRIED THE RULE WITH A VARIETY OF ECONOMIC MODELS AND FOUND IT PRODUCED SMOOTHER G. N. P. GROWTH WITH ESSENTIALLY NO INFLATION 
THE LEGITIMATE RIGHT OF GOVERNMENT TO PRESCRIBE PENALTIES FOR FRAUD IS WELL UNDERSTOOD IN LAW WHEN A GOOD OR SERVICE IS INVOLVED 
LAWS AGAINST FRAUD SHOULD BE NO LESS APPLICABLE TO PLANT CLOSINGS OR MASS LAYOFFS

MR. TANAKA WAS AMONG THE FIRST SCIENTISTS TO RECOGNIZE THE POTENTIAL OF SUPERCONDUCTORS WHICH ARE SUBSTANCES THAT CAN CARRY ELECTRICITY WITH NO RESISTANCE AND THUS NO LOSS OF POWER 
IF MADE PRACTICAL THEY COULD BRING SPECTACULAR CHANGES TO ALMOST ANY ELECTRICAL PRODUCT OR PROCESS 
THAT COULD MEAN VASTLY FASTER AND MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT PRODUCTS SUCH AS COMPUTERS CARS AND HOUSEHOLD APPLIANCES 
BUT UNTIL THE RECENT BREAKTHROUGH SUPERCONDUCTORS HAD TO BE CHILLED TO A HOPELESSLY LOW TEMPERATURE TO WORK SO EXCEPT FOR A FEW APPLICATIONS THERE REALLY WAS NO TECHNOLOGY

MR. JACOBS DESCRIBED THE CURRENT EIGHT PERCENT INFLATION RATE AS HIGHER THAN DESIRABLE

STILL MS. FREEDMAN NOTICED THAT A BRIGHT FORECAST FOR HIRING ISN'T NECESSARILY ALL GOOD NEWS 
THE INCREASING USE OF LABOR MAY BE BECAUSE OF A TREMENDOUS BOOM IN THE OUTPUT OF GOODS AND SERVICES SHE SAID

THE SALE COMPLETES ALLIED'S PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED DIVESTITURE OF ITS ELECTRONICS AND INSTRUMENTATION BUSINESSES 
THE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM INVOLVED THE SALE OF SEVEN COMPANIES INCLUDING NEPTUNE 
PROCEEDS WILL BE USED TO REDUCE DEBT CONTINUE THE COMPANY'S SHARE BUYBACK PROGRAM AND FOR INVESTMENTS 
BUT FIRST CITY WOUND UP MAKING LOANS TO SOME OF THE MOST TROUBLED ENERGY CONCERNS IN TEXAS 
IT CONCENTRATED MORE THAN A THIRD OF ITS ENERGY LENDING IN THE ROLLERCOASTER FORTUNES OF SERVICE AND DRILLING COMPANIES 
WHEN THE ENERGY INDUSTRY WAS GROWING THE LOANS WERE HIGHLY PROFITABLE OFTEN YIELDING TWO OR THREE POINTS OVER THE PRIME RATE 
BUT WHEN OIL PRICES FELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO AND EXPLORATION SLOWED THESE COMPANIES SOME OF THEM YOUNG AND HIGHLY LEVERAGED QUICKLY RAN INTO PROBLEMS 
IN THE END THERE IS LITTLE THE U. S. CAN DO TO CONTROL EVENTS IN SOUTH AFRICA 
THE ADMINISTRATION'S SIX YEAR CONSTRUCTIVE ENGAGEMENT POLICY DESIGNED TO COAX PRETORIA TOWARDS DISMANTLING APARTHEID DIDN'T SUCCEED 
AND SANCTIONS IN THE SHORT RUN WON'T DAMAGE SOUTH AFRICA'S SELF RELIANT ECONOMY 
BUT THE PERCEPTION OF INACTION HAS DIPLOMATIC COSTS FOR THE U. S. AND SO FOR THE TIME BEING SANCTIONS SEEM TO BE THE BEST BET 
BUT EVEN INVESTORS WHO DO ALL THE HOMEWORK AND REQUEST ALL THE DOCUMENTS SHOULDN'T FEEL TOO COMPLACENT 
THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MUST BE UPDATED EVERY YEAR SO NEW PROSPECTUSES ARE ISSUED ANNUALLY 
SOMETIMES ONLY THE PER SHARE DATA TABLE CHANGES BUT OFTEN OTHER REVISIONS ARE INCLUDED 
JUDGE BORK HOWEVER ASKED FOR NONE OF THIS 
BORK DOESN'T WANT A POLITICAL CAMPAIGN MR. GARMENT CONCEDES 
I TOLD HIM I WOULD DO THIS UNLESS HE VIOLENTLY OBJECTED 
HE SAID YOU'RE A FREE AGENT GARMENT 
DO WHAT YOU THINK IS APPROPRIATE 
FACED WITH MOUNTING COMPLAINTS THE STATE DEPARTMENT REMOVED FIDELITY FROM ITS LIST OF RECOMMENDED WAREHOUSES IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND THE COMPANY DECIDED TO SHUT ITS DOORS 
UNDER GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION FIDELITY MOVED THE DIPLOMATS' GOODS TO OTHER WAREHOUSING COMPANIES 
IT HAS OFTEN PROVED IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER GOODS WERE DAMAGED OR LOST BY FIDELITY OR RATHER BY THE WAREHOUSES THEY WERE MOVED TO AFTER FIDELITY FOLDED 
SURELY THE PRODUCER PRICE INDEX HAS BEEN GIVING THE FED NO CAUSE TO WORRY ABOUT INFLATION 
WHEN THE DECEMBER STATISTIC IS RELEASED THIS WEEK ANALYSTS BELIEVE IT WILL SHOW LITTLE OR NO CHANGE FOR THE THIRD MONTH IN A ROW 
ENERGY PRICES STABILIZED AND REBATES HELD DOWN AUTO PRICES 
OFFICIALS HERE ARE SEEING RED OVER VIDEOTAPE CASSETTES 
THEY'RE SEEING GREEN AND BLUE TOO 
BUT WHAT THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE IS BLACK THE COLOR OF THE STANDARD VIDEOCASSETTE CONTAINER IN MANY COUNTRIES 
THE FINANCIAL TIMES THIRTY SHARE INDEX CLOSED SEVEN POINT ONE POINTS LOWER AT ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTEEN POINT FOUR THE DAY'S BEST LEVEL

A BETTER TEST OF THE FED'S INTENTIONS PROBABLY WON'T COME UNTIL MID MARCH MR. MAUDE SAID 
AT THAT TIME TECHNICAL FACTORS NOTABLY CORPORATE TAX PAYMENTS WILL PLACE RENEWED UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE 
IN THE INTERIM HOWEVER THE BEST BET IS TO ASSUME THAT THE FED HAS EASED POLICY 
BUT FOR THE LONGER TERM FIGURING OUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT COMPUTERIZED TRADING MAY BE AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK SOME INVESTORS FEAR 
I'D LOVE FOR ALL THIS STUFF JUST TO GO AWAY 
BUT IT'S LIKE NUCLEAR ENERGY SAYS JOHN B. CARROLL THE VICE PRESIDENT OF G. T. E. CORPORATION'S INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT UNIT 
IT'S THERE AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY 
THE TECHNOLOGY NOW EXISTS FOREVER 
IN ADDITION BATUS IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO FILE FOR APPROVAL OF A TAKEOVER WITH INSURANCE REGULATORS IN NINE WESTERN STATES WHERE FARMERS OPERATES 
APPROVAL BY ALL IS CONSIDERED NECESSARY FOR A SUCCESSFUL TAKEOVER THE COMPANY'S WALL STREET ADVISERS HAVE SAID 
IN ITS OFFER BATUS SIGNALED THAT THE APPROVAL PROCESS MAY TAKE MONTHS 
BUT USING OUTSIDE HELP CAN INVOLVE LARGE AND SOMETIMES SUBTLE COSTS 
MOST TEMPORARY WORKERS AREN'T AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO BE MOTIVATED BY TRADITIONAL INCENTIVES LIKE PAY INCREASES PROMOTIONS OR APPEALS TO CORPORATE LOYALTY 
THUS MANAGERS MUST USE MORE IMAGINATIVE MEANS EXPERTS SAY TO ENSURE THAT PRODUCTIVITY AND PERFORMANCE DON'T SUFFER 
MANY DEBT HOLDERS SHRUGGED OFF THE F. D. I. C.'S THREAT TO ALLOW FIRST CITY'S BANKS TO FAIL 
AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED 
BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS 
IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES 
SHARON ZIEMIAN ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT PRECIOUS METALS AT CITICORP'S CITIBANK N. A. NEW YORK OBSERVED THAT YESTERDAY'S MARKET REFLECTED CONFUSION 
WHILE INFLATION FEARS ABOUND INFLATION ITSELF IS HARD TO ACTUALLY PIN DOWN SHE SAID 
THIS CREATES THE WORRY THAT IF INTEREST RATES ARE RAISED IN ORDER TO COMBAT INFLATION THE FRAGILITY OF THE ECONOMY COULD BRING ABOUT A RECESSION 
ONE DAY THOSE WORDS HAUNT THIS LAND OF IMMENSE SUFFERING 
ONE DAY SAY THE PEASANT FARMERS THE FOURTEEN YEAR BUSH WAR AGAINST ANTI GOVERNMENT REBELS WILL BE OVER 
ONE DAY DROUGHT WILL DISAPPEAR FROM OUR LAND 
ONE DAY THE ECONOMY WILL RECOVER 
ONE DAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO FEED OURSELVES 
NOR IS THE NUMBER SEVENTEEN A MAGIC NUMBER STRESSED DOCTOR SHAW 
IF WE HAD TWO HUNDRED FIFTY COPIES WE MIGHT HAVE FOUND ONE HUNDRED DIFFERENT VIRUSES HE SAID 
HE TERMED THE SPEED OF MUTATION EXTRAORDINARY AND COMPARED THE AIDS VIRUS WITH OTHER SWIFTLY CHANGING VIRUSES SUCH AS INFLUENZA 
DISCUSSION OF THIS SUBJECT BETTER DESCRIBED AS BROODING ABOUT IT IS FILLED WITH MISCONCEPTIONS 
ONE OF THESE IS THE GREAT CONCERN WITH THE U. S. HAVING BECOME A NET DEBTOR 
WHAT IS MEANT BY THAT IS THAT AMERICANS APPARENTLY OWN FEWER ASSETS ABROAD THAN FOREIGNERS OWN IN THE U. S. 
MANY PEOPLE HAVE POINTED OUT THAT THESE CALCULATIONS ARE SPURIOUS BECAUSE THE ASSETS ARE NOT ALL VALUED ON THE SAME BASIS 
IF ALL ASSETS WERE VALUED AT TODAY'S PRICES THE NET DEBT OF THE U. S. WOULD CERTAINLY BE MUCH SMALLER THAN IT NOW APPEARS AND MIGHT BE A NET ASSET 
TOBACCO HEIRESS DORIS DUKE AGREED TO POST FIVE MILLION DOLLARS NEEDED BY IMELDA MARCOS TO SECURE BAIL ON RACKETEERING CHARGES

HIS ARRANGEMENT HAS BEEN DELAYED 
NONE OF THIS MEANS JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WILL BE TRANSFORMED OVERNIGHT 
CHANGE WILL COME SLOWLY BECAUSE JAPANESE SOCIETY STILL HAS A STRONG TENDENCY TO HAMMER DOWN ANY NAIL THAT STICKS UP 
THERE MAY BE GROWING JAPANESE SELF CONFIDENCE IN JAPAN BUT THERE ARE RELATIVELY FEW JAPANESE ENTREPRENEURS 
THERE MAY BE SCADS OF MONEY IN JAPAN BUT THERE IS PRECIOUS LITTLE VENTURE CAPITAL

IT IS A CITATION FREQUENTLY FAVORED AND CONSISTENTLY DISTORTED BY ADVOCATES OF ELASTIC EXECUTIVE POWER 
THE FORMER DARTMOUTH COLLEGE LINEMAN BATTLES BUSINESSES THAT WON'T ADVERTISE ON HIS NEW ORLEANS RADIO STATION BECAUSE OF ITS PRIMARILY BLACK AUDIENCE 
HE WARS WITH WHITE OWNED STATIONS THAT WOULD WOO AWAY HIS LISTENERS 
THE PEOPLE HE PUSHES DON'T LIKE IT MUCH BUT THAT DOESN'T STOP MR. HUTCHINSON 
I DON'T KNOW OF MUCH PROGRESS WITHOUT CONFRONTATION THE BURLY THIRTY NINE YEAR OLD SAYS 
AT THE TIME OF THE INDICTMENT PROSECUTORS FAULTED O. S. H. A. FOR FAILING TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON ALLEGED SAFETY PROBLEMS AFTER BEING TOLD OF THE PYMM WORKROOM 
AFTER NEW YORK STATE OFFICIALS BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE COMPANY IN FEBRUARY O. S. H. A. CITED PYMM FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF FEDERAL SAFETY STANDARDS 
O. S. H. A. OFFICIALS LATER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PYMM CASE HAD BEEN MISHANDLED 
THE PROFESSOR SAYS HE HAS ALSO FOUND THAT FINANCIAL RISK TAKERS TEND TO BELIEVE IN GOD MORE THAN THE MEEK INVESTOR DOES 
EVEN WHEN THE RELIGIOUSLY INCLINED MAKE AN INVESTMENT MISTAKE HE SAYS THEY BOUNCE BACK 
THEY HAVE A SENSE THEY'VE GOT GOD ON THEIR SIDE 
UNHAMPERED BY GLASS STEAGALL THE BANK BOARD SAID IT WOULD ALLOW <UNK> SECURITIES AND THRIFT BUSINESSES TO MARKET EACH OTHER'S PRODUCTS 
IT IMPOSED TEMPORARY SAFEGUARDS ON CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS FOR SIX MONTHS BETWEEN THE TWO ACTIVITIES WHILE IT CONSIDERS WHAT LONG TERM RESTRICTIONS ARE NEEDED 
MS. COHEN SAID THE TEMPORARY RESTRICTIONS INCLUDED A BAR AGAINST THE SECURITIES FIRM PASSING ON INSIDER INFORMATION ABOUT SECURITIES DEALS BUT SHE LACKED FURTHER DETAILS 
CENTERRE SAID THAT IT HAD RECEIVED WHAT IT CALLED BOATMEN'S OFFER FOR A FRIENDLY MERGER AND WAS EVALUATING THE PROPOSAL WITH ITS FINANCIAL ADVISERS 
PENDING SUCH EVALUATION AND CLARIFICATION CENTERRE IS ACTIVELY PURSUING THE CONSOLIDATION WITH MERCANTILE CENTERRE SAID 
THE COMPANY ADDED THAT CENTERRE SHAREHOLDERS SHOULD NOT ASSUME THAT THE CONSOLIDATION WITH MERCANTILE WILL NOT OCCUR 
THE MANAGEMENT GROUP ALREADY OWNS ABOUT TWENTY PERCENT OF OUTLET AN OUTLET SPOKESMAN SAID 
THE GROUP LAST DECEMBER SIGNED AN AGREEMENT GIVING IT THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE COMPANIES' STAKES IN OUTLET FOR TWENTY TWO DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS A SHARE 
IT IS NOW MAKING AN OFFICIAL OFFER FOR THE SHARES 
ON THE SPENDING SIDE CONSUMPTION PROBABLY INCREASED AGAIN IN JULY HELPED ALONG ONCE MORE BY CAR AND LIGHT TRUCK SALES 
ECONOMISTS EXPECT THE GOVERNMENT TO REPORT THAT JULY CONSUMER SPENDING ROSE ABOUT ZERO POINT SIX PERCENT 
IN JUNE PERSONAL CONSUMPTION ROSE ONE POINT OH PERCENT 
SOME ANALYSTS SAY THE SLOWDOWN COULD LEAD TO ANOTHER ROUND OF COST CUTTING AMONG A NUMBER OF MAKERS OF STANDARD CHIPS WHERE FACTORIES ARE RUNNING FAR BELOW CAPACITY 
NATIONAL'S PLANTS WILL BE PRODUCING AT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT TO SEVENTY PERCENT OF CAPACITY EVEN AFTER SEVERAL FACTORIES ARE SHUTTERED THIS YEAR 
AT L. S. I. LOGIC CORPORATION OVERCAPACITY IS THE ONLY THING BETWEEN US AND PROFITABILITY SAYS GEORGE D. WELLS PRESIDENT AND CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER 
M. M. S. SURVEYED ECONOMISTS ON PRODUCER PRICES BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER FRIDAY'S EMPLOYMENT REPORT WITH ONLY MARGINALLY DIFFERENT RESULTS 
THE RANGE OF ESTIMATES ON THE FIRST SURVEY RAN FROM A DECLINE OF ZERO POINT TWO PERCENT TO AN INCREASE OF ZERO POINT FOUR PERCENT 
AFTER THE JOBS REPORT THE POLL RANGED FROM A DECLINE OF ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT TO AN INCREASE OF ZERO POINT THREE PERCENT

THE SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANY ISN'T THE OBJECT OF A TAKEOVER EFFORT 
SUCH A CHARGE HAD BEEN EXPECTED 
NEW YORK STATE ELECTRIC SAID THE EXPENSE WILL END ITS NINE YEAR STRING OF DIVIDEND INCREASES 
THE COMPANY SAID IT IS HOPEFUL BUT NOT CERTAIN THAT THE DIVIDEND WON'T BE LOWERED FROM THE CURRENT SIXTY SIX CENTS QUARTERLY

REGULATORS AREN'T ALLOWING THE UTILITY AN EIGHTEEN PERCENT OWNER OF THE PROJECT TO PASS THAT ALONG TO CUSTOMERS

CAESARS PROPOSED TO PAY HOLDERS A ONE TIME TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR A SHARE CASH DIVIDEND AND INCUR ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF NEW DEBT 
HOLDERS WOULD RETAIN EQUITY IN A MORE HIGHLY LEVERAGED CAESARS A LOS ANGELES BASED OWNER OF CASINO HOTELS 
ANALYSTS AND INVESTMENT BANKERS PLACED THE VALUE OF THE EQUITY AT BETWEEN SIX DOLLARS AND SEVEN DOLLARS A SHARE 
THE SHARES ALSO MEAN A LOT TO THE SON WHO NOW COUNTS THE BANK AMONG HIS CLIENTS 
IT'S A VERY SPECIAL FEELING HE SAYS 
IT GIVES ME A NICE LINK WITH THE PAST 
CURRENT FASHION SEEMS TO BE TO PREDICT MAN MADE ECOLOGICAL DISASTERS WITH THE DESTRUCTION OF TROPICAL FORESTS AS ONE OF THE FRONT RUNNERS 
ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED BY CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY SOME OF THESE POTENTIAL DISASTERS HAVE A SOUND PHYSICAL BASIS AND NEED TO BE DISCUSSED SERIOUSLY 
IN ADDITION TO DEFORESTATION EXAMPLES ARE 
IN ADDITION U. S. AIR HAS DEMANDED THAT P. S. A.'S UNIONS AGREE TO CHANGE CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF EXISTING CONTRACTS THAT RELATE TO MERGERS OR ACQUISITIONS 
A P. S. GROUP SPOKESMAN DECLINED TO SAY EXACTLY WHAT THE PROVISIONS ARE 
HE SAID HOWEVER THAT THEY CONCERN THE RIGHTS OF THE UNION ORGANIZATIONS AND DON'T AFFECT EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION OR BENEFITS 
MOREOVER GREYHOUND HAS TAKEN SOME TROUBLING STUMBLES IN THE DAY TO DAY MANAGEMENT OF ITS OPERATIONS 
LAST YEAR FOR INSTANCE PROFIT PLUMMETED AT THE PUREX UNIT <UNK> A RESULT OF MAJOR MARKETING MISCALCULATIONS 
TWO MAJOR ALLEGED FRAUDS HAVE CROPPED UP IN THE COMPANY'S LEASING OPERATIONS 
EVEN FOOD SERVICE OPERATIONS WHICH MR. TEETS KNOWS WELL HAVE BEEN HURT BADLY BY THE UNEVEN ECONOMIC RECOVERY 
IT'S BEEN OBVIOUS FOR YEARS THAT AMERICANS SAVE FAR TOO LITTLE 
EVER SINCE THE NEW DEAL WE'VE BECOME MORE AND MORE A NATION OF CONSUMERS 
BUT THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS A FREE LUNCH WHAT WE SPEND NOW IS BORROWED FROM THE NEXT GENERATION 
MR. THEOBALD SAID HE DIDN'T ACCEPT THE POSITION WHICH IS EFFECTIVE AUGUST THE FIRST MERELY TO BE A BIG BANK CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR POWER 
I HAVE ALL THE AUTHORITY I NEED AT CITICORP HE SAID NOTICING THAT THE INVESTMENT BANKING OPERATION HE HEADED THERE IS ITSELF BIGGER THAN CONTINENTAL 
DEATH IS THE KEY WORD SAID ONE INDIVIDUAL FAMILIAR WITH I. C. N. 
THERE ARE SOME KEY SHARES IN SOME VERY AGED HANDS AND THE FATE OF THIS COMPANY HINGES ON THESE SHARES 
I DON'T THINK ANYONE COULD BUY THEM TODAY BUT THINGS CHANGE WHEN PEOPLE DIE 
A <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> <UNK> OFFICIAL SAID THE DESTRUCTION WEDNESDAY OF A ROCKET FUEL PLANT IN SOUTHERN NEVADA THREATENED U. S. PLANS TO REBUILD ITS SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM

!NOISE AT LEAST ONE PERSON WAS KILLED AND MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY PEOPLE WERE INJURED IN THE BLASTS 
THE MIDLAND TEXAS BASED PARTNERSHIP'S LATEST PROPOSAL GIVES TWO OPTIONS BOTH OF WHICH REQUIRE A NEGOTIATED MERGER AGREEMENT 
ONE OPTION OFFERS MORE CASH PER SHARE BUT FOR FEWER SHARES 
THE OTHER SEEKS THE ENTIRE NINETY PERCENT STAKE IN U. S. G. THAT DESERT PARTNERS DOESN'T ALREADY OWN BUT HEAVILY INCREASES THE DEBT PORTION OF THE BID 
HOWEVER MOST FORECASTERS DON'T FORESEE A PERMANENT BREAK IN THE DROUGHT ANYTIME SOON 
THAT WON'T HAPPEN UNTIL THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OUT OF THE MIDWEST AMONG OTHER THINGS 
EVEN A RETURN TO A NORMAL SUMMER WEATHER PATTERN WOULD DO LITTLE TO PREVENT MORE DAMAGE TO CROPS 
THE SOIL IN MANY FARM STATES DIDN'T GET THE SPRINGTIME MOISTURE THAT CROPS NEED TO SURVIVE THE NORMALLY HOT AND DRY JULY AND AUGUST WEATHER 
IN MORE WAYS THAN NOT HOWEVER MR. JOBS IS HIS OLD SELF AN INTENSE OUTSPOKEN PERFECTIONIST DRIVING HIS EMPLOYEES AS HARD AS THEY WILL LET HIM

ACCORDING TO MINUTES OF THE MEETING MEMBERS OF THE PANEL DECIDED TO MAKE NO CHANGES IN THEIR CREDIT STANCE 
BUT THEY INDICATED WILLINGNESS TO TIGHTEN POLICY IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUED TO SHOW STRENGTH IF THE DOLLAR DROPPED SUBSTANTIALLY OR IF INFLATIONARY PRESSURES PICKED UP 
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES A TIGHTER FED POLICY WOULD PRESUMABLY LEAD TO HIGHER INTEREST RATES 
THE LATEST REPORT MAY LEAD TO SPECULATION THAT THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERED TIGHTENING POLICY AT ITS MOST RECENT MEETING LAST WEEK 
SINCE THE FEBRUARY MEETING THE ECONOMY HAS CONTINUED TO SHOW SIGNS OF MODEST GROWTH THE DOLLAR HAS FALLEN FURTHER AND CONSUMER PRICES HAVE PICKED UP SLIGHTLY 
THE FED WON'T DISCLOSE WHETHER A DECISION WAS REACHED AT LAST WEEK'S MEETING UNTIL AFTER ITS CUSTOMARY DELAY OF SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS 
U. S. WEST INCORPORATED BOOSTED ITS QUARTERLY DIVIDEND SEVEN POINT NINE PERCENT TO EIGHTY TWO CENTS A SHARE PAYABLE MAY FIRST TO STOCK OF RECORD APRIL SIXTEENTH

THE INCREASE REFLECTS CONFIDENCE IN THE DIRECTION AND STRENGTH OF OUR COMPANY SAID HOWARD DOERR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
LAST MONTH OVERALL GOODS PRODUCING EMPLOYMENT FELL SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND AFTER A THIRTY TWO THOUSAND JOB RISE IN FEBRUARY

CONSTRUCTION EMPLOYMENT FELL FORTY SEVEN THOUSAND AFTER A FIFTEEN THOUSAND JOB DECLINE THE MONTH BEFORE 
MINING EMPLOYMENT WHICH INCLUDES THE OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION INDUSTRY ROSE THREE THOUSAND AFTER A ONE THOUSAND JOB RISE

IT SAID THAT SIXTEEN PERCENT OF THE PURCHASING MANAGERS REPORTED HIGHER EMPLOYMENT THE GREATEST PERCENTAGE SINCE MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
IT SAID THAT FOURTEEN PERCENT REPORTED LOWER EMPLOYMENT THE LOWEST SINCE SEPTEMBER NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR 
THAT'S IN LARGE PART THE RESULT OF INVESTORS' INTEREST IN JAPANESE EQUITIES 
JAPANESE BANKS AND CORPORATIONS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT INTEREST BY OFFERING EURODOLLAR BONDS THAT OFFER AN EQUITY PLAY 
AS MUCH AS TWO POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS OF SUCH ISSUES MAY COME TO MARKET THIS MONTH 
NISSAN WAS ONE OF ONLY TWO JAPANESE COMPANIES TO REPORT HIGHER SALES FOR MARCH 
THE OTHER WAS MITSUBISHI MOTORS CORPORATION'S U. S. SALES OPERATION 
BOTH COMPANIES OFFERED DEALERS CASH INCENTIVES DURING THE MONTH NISSAN ON THREE OF ITS BEST SELLING CARS AND MITSUBISHI ON ALL BUT ONE OF ITS PASSENGER CARS 
REPRESENTATIVES FOR THE TWO IMPORTERS SAID THE PROGRAMS HAVE ENDED AND NEW INCENTIVES HAVEN'T BEEN ANNOUNCED 
THE CHIEF TRADER IN NEW YORK FOR A TOKYO BASED BANK AGREES 
EVEN IF JAPANESE INVESTORS DON'T SELL DOLLARS SOMEBODY ELSE WILL HE SAYS 
THE TREND IS INEVITABLE UNLESS THE GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE WHOLE WORLD 
WHAT BEGAN AS A LACKLUSTER SESSION FRIDAY GATHERED STEAM AS THE DOLLAR GAINED SOME GROUND AGAINST OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES 
SOME OF THE DEMAND CAME FROM BUY PROGRAMS TIED TO STOCK INDEX FUTURES

A LOT OF INSTITUTIONS WANT TO INVEST IN BROAD FUNDS CHEAPLY AND EXPEDITIOUSLY HE SAID 
THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN DO THAT NOW IS IN THE FUTURES MARKET

BUT IN COMPOSITE TRADING YESTERDAY ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE THE STOCK CLOSED AT THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS UP ONE DOLLAR AND FIFTY CENTS

SHORT INTEREST IS A MEASURE OF NEGATIVE SENTIMENT TOWARDS FUTURE PRICES IN THE MARKET 
IN RECENT YEARS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE FIGURES ON THE BIG EXCHANGES HAS BECOME CLOUDED BY SHORT SELLING AS PART OF ARBITRAGE TRANSACTIONS RELATED MOSTLY TO STOCK OPTIONS

IN ADDITION THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT IS PROPOSING TO LIMIT INSURERS' INVESTMENTS IN JUNK BONDS TO NO MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR ASSETS 
FIRST EXECUTIVE'S NEW YORK UNIT HAD AT LEAST FIFTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ITS ASSETS IN JUNK BONDS AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THE NEW YORK DEPARTMENT ESTIMATES 
THE PROPOSAL WOULDN'T REQUIRE A COMPANY TO SELL JUNK BONDS THAT EXCEEDED THE NEW LIMIT BUT WOULD BAR FUTURE PURCHASES 
HOW AN IMPROVEMENT IN THE FARM ECONOMY WILL BEAR ON THIS ISSUE WHICH IS LIKELY TO COME TO A HEAD IN CONGRESS THIS FALL IS A GOOD QUESTION 
ONE ARGUMENT MOST LIKELY WILL BE THAT THE IMPROVEMENT MAKES IT SAFER FOR THE TREASURY TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT 
THE CONTRARY ARGUMENT IS THAT THE BANKS ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO DEAL WITH THEIR OWN WOE 
OF COURSE THIS MISUSE IS NOT OF WORLD SHATTERING IMPORTANCE 
IT IS ALSO NOT THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH OUR LANGUAGE HAS EXPANDED THROUGH MISAPPLICATION OF TERMS

IT HAS SINCE REBOUNDED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FORTY FIVE POINT FIVE SEVEN WHERE IT CLOSED FRIDAY LOSING FOUR POINT FIVE SEVEN POINTS IN THE SESSION 
FOR THE MOMENT HOWEVER THE BIGGEST PROBLEM FOR FAMILY BUSINESS OWNERS IS THE UNCERTAINTY OVER WHAT TO DO WHILE WAITING TO SEE IF THE PROPOSAL BECOMES LAW

AFTER WORLD WAR TWO THE FIRST GOODS JAPAN TRIED TO MARKET IN THE U. S. WERE NOT GEARED TO THE U. S. MARKET AT ALL

THE HAFTS WHO CONTROL DART GROUP CORPORATION HAVE SAID THEY WANT TO BUY ANOTHER MAJOR RETAILER 
THEY CURRENTLY ARE INTERESTED IN ACQUIRING KROGER COMPANY

NO ONE IS PROJECTING A PRECIPITOUS PRICE PLUMMET LIKE THE ONE THAT DRAGGED THE INDUSTRY INTO A RECESSION IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE AND NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
LOWER SALES MAY REFLECT SEASONAL FACTORS WHICH MAY BE COMPOUNDED BY CHANGING BUYING HABITS AMONG PURCHASERS 
SOME PURCHASERS EXPECT DEMAND TO PICK UP SOON

SOME STEEL EXECUTIVES THOUGH THINK THE INDUSTRY MAY BE OVERREACTING 
FRANKLY I DON'T THINK THE DEMAND HAS FALLEN OFF AS DRAMATICALLY AS SOME SERVICE CENTERS FEAR SAYS AN EXECUTIVE AT A MIDWESTERN SERVICE CENTER

THE QUESTION OF HOW MANY DAYS IN ADVANCE A TICKET HAS TO BE PURCHASED IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY 
THE MORE RESTRICTIVE THE ADVANCE PURCHASE REQUIREMENT THE LESS DAMAGING A CHEAP FARE IS FOR THE AIRLINE 
THAT'S MAINLY BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FARE PARTICULARLY BUSINESS TRAVELERS IS LIMITED 
ONE REASON THE MAXSAVER HAS ATTRACTED SO MUCH ATTENTION IS THAT ITS TWO DAY ADVANCE PURCHASE REQUIREMENT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR VIRTUALLY ANYBODY TO USE THE FARE 
BUT IT PROBABLY WOULD BE A MOOT ISSUE HE SAID BECAUSE THE I. C. O. CAN'T PULL THE PRICE UP TO ANY LEVEL 
THE MARKET HAS TO DO THAT 
AND THE I. C. O. HAS NEVER IGNORED THE MARKET PRICE PREVAILING WHEN IT SETS THE QUOTA PRICE RANGE

THIS WEEK THE HOUSE FOREIGN AFFAIRS COMMITTEE APPROVED A BAN ON VIRTUALLY ALL U. S. INVESTMENT AND TRADE WITH SOUTH AFRICA 
IT IS GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE SANCTIONS ALREADY IN PLACE HAVE CAUSED THOUSANDS OF BLACK SOUTH AFRICANS TO LOSE THEIR JOBS 
WHAT ISN'T KNOWN IS THAT SANCTIONS HAVE COST JUST TWO SMALL PARTS OF THE U. S. ECONOMY MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE 
F. C. A. CONFIRMED THAT IT HAS REACHED A TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION STEMMING FROM THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE 
THE COMPANY SAID IT REDUCED A RESERVE FOR SUCH A SETTLEMENT TO EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS 
THE REDUCTION IN THE RESERVE AMOUNT ALSO REDUCED THE FIRST QUARTER NET LOSS BY SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS 
THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER 
FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE 
SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL 
BUT THE FED IS ALSO UNDER INTENSE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO AVOID RAISING INTEREST RATES BEFORE THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION 
ALL SIX FED GOVERNORS WERE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN AND FED CHAIRMAN ALAN GREENSPAN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY 
FED OFFICIALS ALSO WORRY THAT SHARPLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD DAMAGE STILL WEAK SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY AND EXACERBATE PROBLEMS AMONG TROUBLED BANKS AND THRIFT INSTITUTIONS 
CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE 
HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER 
BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES 
THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO 
A DROP IN OIL PRICES COULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME PRICE RELIEF AS IT DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX 
THE RECENT FAILURE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO REACH AN AGREEMENT LIMITING PRODUCTION SUGGESTS PRICES MIGHT FALL SOME 
BUT ANY DIP IN INFLATION ASSOCIATED WITH OIL PRICES IS LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY 
L. T. V. WILL PRESENT THE PLAN TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF ITS BANK AND CREDITOR COMMITTEES NEXT WEEK 
BUT THE PLAN WON'T BE FILED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT UNTIL THE CREDITORS AND L. T. V. AGREE ON HOW THE DEBT WILL BE PAID 
THAT COULD TAKE YEARS 
INVESTMENT BANKERS SAID IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET MANY DIFFERENT ISSUERS INVESTORS DEALERS AND CUSTODIANS TO AGREE ON A SINGLE BOOK ENTRY METHOD 
IN ADDITION ONE BANKER SAID THAT A BOOK ENTRY SYSTEM RAISED LEGAL QUESTIONS ABOUT LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER'S DEFAULT 
OTHERS SAID THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS THAT ACT AS CUSTODIANS DIDN'T WANT TO SURRENDER THE LUCRATIVE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH HANDLING PHYSICAL SECURITIES 
BUT SO CAREFULLY HIDDEN IS MR. MARCOS WEALTH THAT INVESTIGATORS STILL CAN ONLY GUESS AT ITS SIZE 
SOME OF HIS INVESTMENTS MAY NEVER BE FOUND BECAUSE THEY ARE ADROITLY DISGUISED AND BURIED IN LAYERS OF OWNERSHIP

MARCOS LOYALISTS REMAIN ENTRENCHED IN THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY AND CAN STYMIE THE INVESTIGATION AND THEY ARE SO POWERFUL IN BUSINESS THAT THEY STILL LARGELY CONTROL THE ECONOMY 
IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. MAXWELL SAID HE WANTS TO ACQUIRE GUINNESS PEAT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL ACCORDING TO MR. JAY
