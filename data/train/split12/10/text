c21c020s-head FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD SPOKESMAN JOSEPH COYNE SAID YESTERDAY'S ACTION WAS DONE ENTIRELY AT CITICORP'S INITIATIVE
c21c020t-head ALTHOUGH FED OFFICIALS WERE ADVISED OF THE BANK'S PLANS IT WAS THEIR OWN JUDGMENT OF WHAT KIND OF RESERVE POSITIONS THEY SHOULD MAKE MR. COYNE SAID
c21c020u-head WE DON'T CONSIDER THIS A PRECEDENT FOR OTHER BANKS
c21c020v-head THE IRAN CONTRA PANEL'S BIG SCENE GOT OFF WITH A BANG YESTERDAY !NOISE
c21c020w-head LIEUTENANT COLONEL OLLIE NORTH WAS SWORN IN AND BRENDAN SULLIVAN JUNIOR HIS LAWYER PROMPTLY SET OUT TO PROVE THAT WITNESSES CAN TALK BACK AT A CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
c21c020x-head HE ACCUSED THE COMMITTEE OF WORKING HAND IN GLOVE WITH THE SPECIAL PROSECUTOR THREATENING TO *INDICT* HIS CLIENT AND USING DIRTY TRICKS BESIDES
c21c020y-head MOTT'S SAID IT DECIDED TO LEAVE THE SUPERMARKET INDUSTRY BECAUSE IT DIDN'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO COMPETE
c21c020z-head THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO OWN AND OPERATE TWO RETAIL LIQUOR STORES AND TO HOLD INTERESTS IN SEVERAL SHOPPING CENTERS
c21c0210-head THESE BUSINESSES ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THE COMPANY'S SALES LAST YEAR OF TWO HUNDRED NINETY POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS

c21c021b-head !NOISE I COME WITH NO BAGGAGE WITH NO PRECONCEIVED IDEAS ABOUT THE BEST *REGULATORY* METHOD OR THE BEST WAY THE MARKET SHOULD OPERATE
c21c021c-head I COME WITH VERY STRONG CONCEPTUAL SKILLS WITH VERY STRONG HISTORICAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE REGULATION OF THE SECURITIES MARKETS
c21c021d-head THE GROUP SAID IN THE FILING THAT IT ACQUIRED THE STOCK FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES
c21c021e-head A SPOKESMAN FOR THE INVESTOR GROUP DECLINED TO ELABORATE ON THE FILING
c21c021f-head GREENMAN OFFICIALS WERE UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
c21c021g-head THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE A TENDER OFFER FOR ITS PREFERRED SHARES AT TWENTY ONE DOLLARS AND FORTY CENTS A SHARE
c21c021h-head MOST OF THE MORE THAN FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS REQUIRED TO RETIRE THE PREFERRED STOCK WOULD BE BORROWED MR. MOORE SAID
c21c021i-head AT THE SAME TIME THE COMPANY WOULD RESTRUCTURE EXISTING BANK LOANS
c21c021j-head FOR A SHIP OR MISSILE GUIDED BY THE WRONG TIME SIGNAL THAT LITTLE GAP COULD MEAN ARRIVING AT THE WRONG DESTINATION
c21c021k-head IF WE LET THE DIFFERENCE GROW SAYS MR. MCCARTHY WE COULD RUN INTO PROBLEMS OVER THOUSANDS OF YEARS
c21c021l-head IT MIGHT BE NOON BY ATOMIC TIME BUT DARK OUTSIDE
c21c021m-head THE MOST ACTIVE ISSUE WAS INTEL THE BIG SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY WHICH ROSE ONE QUARTER TO TWENTY EIGHT AND ONE QUARTER
c21c021n-head BUT SOME OTHER BIG ELECTRONICS SHARES SURGED LATE IN THE DAY
c21c021o-head S. C. I. SYSTEMS CLIMBED THREE QUARTERS TO FOURTEEN AND THREE EIGHTHS ON TWO HUNDRED NINE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED SHARES
c21c021p-head ONE LONGTIME EASTERN PILOT INSISTED THAT THE SAFETY CAMPAIGN INVOLVED NUMEROUS SERIOUS PROBLEMS BUT AFFIRMED THAT THE CARDS OFTEN CONTAINED INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR REGULATORS TO ACT ON
c21c021q-head I SENT IN SIX CARDS MYSELF THE PILOT SAID INCLUDING SOME INVOLVING INSUFFICIENT TAKEOFF POWER BECAUSE OF MECHANICAL PROBLEMS
c21c021r-head BUT TO IDENTIFY THE PLANE BY NUMBER OR FLIGHT TIME HE ADDED WOULD BE AN ADMISSION OF OUR OWN CULPABILITY IN THE PROBLEM
c21c021s-head ANOTHER EASTERN PILOT SAID THAT DESPITE MR. BURNLEY'S CRITICISM HE CONSIDERED THE CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS
c21c021t-head INOPERATIVE ITEMS THAT ONCE PERSISTED FOR WEEKS ARE BEING REPAIRED MORE CONSISTENTLY HE SAID
c21c021u-head AFTER LARRY SPEAKES LOST HIS JOB WITH MERRILL LYNCH I WAS A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO JOIN THE POSSE OF CRITICS
c21c021v-head YOU HATE TO KICK A GUY WHEN HE'S DOWN
c21c021w-head BUT SOMETHING MADE ME CHANGE MY MIND
c21c021x-head I READ HIS BOOK
c21c021y-head BUT SENATOR DAVID BOREN D. OKLAHOMA THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC
c21c021z-head THIS IS NO WAY TO BEGIN A RELATIONSHIP UNDER A TREATY AS IMPORTANT AS THIS IF THESE DELIBERATE AMBIGUITIES REMAIN HE TOLD REPORTERS
c21c0220-head SENATOR COHEN ALSO SAID HE IS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAT THE U. S. SOVIET DIFFERENCES CAN BE RESOLVED QUICKLY
c21c0221-head MR. GORBACHEV'S EFFORTS TO MODERNIZE THE SOVIET ECONOMY RAISE THE PROSPECTS OF WIDENING COMMERCIAL TIES BETWEEN EAST AND WEST
c21c0222-head MOSCOW'S DECISION TO WITHDRAW FROM AFGHANISTAN HAS REDUCED U. S. FEARS OF SOVIET EXPANSION
c21c0223-head MOST IMPORTANT MR. REAGAN LIKE BRITISH PRIME MINISTER MARGARET THATCHER FINDS THAT HE CAN DEAL WITH MR. GORBACHEV
c21c0224-head THE SUPERPOWER CHIEFS HAVE NEGOTIATED ARMS CONTROL AGREEMENTS AND TALKED OF ENDING THE ARMS RACE
c21c0225-head THE FOLLOWING OFFICERS DIRECTORS AND LARGE STOCKHOLDERS OF COMPANIES REPORTED CHANGES IN HOLDINGS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR
c21c0226-head THOSE IDENTIFIED AS BENEFICIAL OWNERS HOLD AT LEAST TEN PERCENT OF A COMPANY'S EQUITY SECURITIES
c21c0227-head UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED CHANGES INVOLVED DIRECT HOLDINGS OF COMMON STOCK AND TOOK PLACE IN MAY NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT
c21c0228-head COMPANIES ARE LISTED WHERE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY AGGREGATE TEN THOUSAND SHARES OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
c21c0229-head THUS INSTEAD OF CALMAT'S BEING ACQUIRED SELECT ASSETS WOULD BE OPTIONED AND A HUNK OF STOCK WOULD BE IN RELATIVELY SAFE HANDS
c21c022a-head CALMAT WOULD BE RID OF MR. BRIERLEY WHO APPEARS TO HAVE TRIED TO PUT THE COMPANY IN PLAY
c21c022b-head INDUSTRIAL EQUITY EXECUTIVES IN CALIFORNIA DIDN'T RETURN CALLS SEEKING COMMENT
c21c022c-head PERNOD SAYS THE FYFFES SHARE WOULD GIVE IT CONTROL OF MORE THAN FIFTY PERCENT OF IRISH DISTILLERS STOCK
c21c022d-head IF THE COURT DEEMS THE ORAL AGREEMENT INVALID THE BIDDING WOULD REOPEN
c21c022e-head BUT REGARDLESS OF THE COURT DECISION THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY COMMISSION OR IRELAND'S FAIR TRADE COMMISSION COULD BLOCK ANY BID
c21c022f-head NOT SINCE THE NINETEEN THIRTIES HAVE CITIZENS PLACED SO MANY INITIATIVES ON STATE BALLOTS
c21c022g-head MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES
c21c022h-head WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
c21c022i-head A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATORS ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT
c21c022j-head NOT ALL BLACK COLLEGES ARE ON THE ROPES
c21c022k-head IN FACT A NUMBER OF ELITE INSTITUTIONS ARE THRIVING IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL FUND RAISING EFFORTS
c21c022l-head LAST WEEK FOR INSTANCE MR. COSBY AND HIS WIFE CAMILLE DONATED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO SPELMAN COLLEGE A BLACK WOMEN'S COLLEGE IN ATLANTA

c22a010d-head UNUSUALLY HIGH LEVELS OF RADIATION WERE DETECTED IN MANY EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
c22a010e-head BOTH PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS DEPOSITS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH EASTERN OHIO
c22a010f-head FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS THE REPUBLICANS ALSO CAPTURED BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS
c22a010g-head THE SOUTH CAROLINA EDUCATIONAL RADIO NETWORK HAS WON NATIONAL BROADCASTING AWARDS
c22a010h-head A TANKER IS A SHIP DESIGNED TO CARRY LARGE VOLUMES OF OIL OR OTHER LIQUID CARGO
c22a010i-head THE ENORMOUS AMOUNTS OF CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSE THIS HIGH PRESSURE
c22c0201-head OCTOBER'S CONTRACTING FOR TRANSPORTATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRUCTION SURGED THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT TO AN ANNUAL RATE OF FORTY FOUR POINT THREE NINE BILLION DOLLARS FOLLOWING A SHARP DECLINE IN SEPTEMBER
c22c0202-head THE RALLY IN PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION DOMINATED THE MONTH'S ACTIVITY
c22c0203-head MODEST GAINS IN HOME BUILDING WERE OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NONRESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION
c22c0204-head MR. ABBOUD ALSO GAINED A REPUTATION DURING THE FIRST CHICAGO YEARS AS BEING ABRASIVE AND SOMETIMES HARSH WITH SUBORDINATES AND THAT TAG HAS LINGERED
c22c0205-head I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ADJECTIVE USED SO MUCH IN CONNECTION WITH A PERSON'S NAME HE SAID IN A NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR INTERVIEW
c22c0206-head PEOPLE THINK THE A. IN A. ROBERT ABBOUD STANDS FOR ABRASIVE
c22c0207-head BEING ENGLISH AND A WORKING CLASS NORTH LONDONER AT THAT IS A BIG PART OF MISS FOX'S APPEAL IN BRITAIN WHERE CLASS DISTINCTIONS STILL COUNT
c22c0208-head THERE'S NOTHING PATRICIAN ABOUT HER LOOKS WHICH SUITS HER FANS HERE JUST FINE
c22c0209-head A LOT OF YOUNG WOMEN HERE LOOK A LOT LIKE HER
c22c020a-head EVEN MORE SOUND LIKE HER
c22c020b-head AND NO ONE EXPECTS OR WANTS HER TO SUDDENLY DON SNOOTY JASPER CONRAN FROCKS AND POSE ON THE PAGES OF VOGUE
c22c020c-head BUT SIX YEARS OF HUGE TRADE DEFICITS AND BUDGET DEFICITS HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT
c22c020d-head BY THE END OF LAST YEAR THE DEPARTMENT SAYS FOREIGNERS HELD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS MORE IN U. S. ASSETS THAN AMERICANS HELD OVERSEAS
c22c020e-head SOME ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS DOUBT THE ACCURACY OF THOSE NUMBERS BUT NO ONE QUESTIONS THE TREND
c22c020f-head IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M.
c22c020g-head ONE INDICATION THAT PATTERN BARGAINING MAY BE BREAKING DOWN IS THE WIDE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO AUTO MAKERS' INITIAL PROPOSALS
c22c020h-head IN THE PAST BOTH COMPANIES HAVE PRESENTED VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL OFFERS ON THE SAME DAY
c22c020i-head A BIG COMPANY WOULD JUST HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE SAME BAD TEAM HE EXPLAINS
c22c020j-head THEY WASTE HUGE AMOUNTS
c22c020k-head THAT'S WHY WE AREN'T AT A DISADVANTAGE WITH THEM
c22c020l-head I. R. E. HAS DOWNSIZED ITS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION BUSINESS AND IS PRIMARILY A SAVINGS AND LOAN HOLDING COMPANY MR. LEVAN SAID
c22c020m-head EARNINGS IN THE PAST WERE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC QUARTER TO QUARTER BECAUSE THE MAJOR BUSINESS WAS REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
c22c020n-head NOW THE S. AND L. HOLDING COMPANY IS THE MAIN BUSINESS WITH DOWN SIZED REAL ESTATE SYNDICATION
c22c020o-head CORE EARNINGS ARE VERY CONSISTENT
c22c020p-head IN A STATEMENT TIMEPLEX SAID ITS DIRECTORS VOTED TO POSTPONE THE ANNUAL MEETING WHICH WAS SCHEDULED FOR YESTERDAY
c22c020q-head A NEW DATE HASN'T BEEN SET
c22c020r-head A UNISYS SPOKESMAN SAID THE COMPANIES HOPE TO COMPLETE THE ACQUISITION WHICH REQUIRES TIMEPLEX HOLDERS' APPROVAL AND GOVERNMENT CLEARANCE IN ABOUT FOUR MONTHS
c22c020s-head LAST WEEK'S ANNUAL DINNER LUNCHEONS AND OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE BRITISH INSTITUTE OF PETROLEUM WERE CROWDED TO CAPACITY
c22c020t-head THE SCORES OF PRIVATE MEETINGS AND PARTIES WERE AS LIVELY AS EVER
c22c020u-head BUT THERE WERE FEWER HOSPITALITY SUITES
c22c020v-head AND MOST OF THE FOUR THOUSAND TO FIVE THOUSAND OILMEN HERE FOR THE SO CALLED I. P. WEEK HEADED HOME IN A SOMBER MOOD
c22c020w-head OUTSIDE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP PATIENCE IS WEARING THIN ON PORK BARRELING CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS
c22c020x-head THERE ARE EVEN CONGRESSMEN WHO SAY THEY WANT TO PASS SEPARATE BUDGET BILLS THIS YEAR
c22c020y-head WE'LL SEE
c22c020z-head WHAT SEEMS MORE LIKELY IS THAT EITHER A PRESIDENT OR THE COURTS OR BOTH SOMEDAY WILL HAVE TO RESCUE THE VETO BY FORCING CONGRESS TO GIVE UP ITS ARROGANT WAYS
c22c0210-head BANKAMERICA IS NOW WRITING OFF FEWER OF ITS PROBLEM LOANS THAN MOST OTHER LARGE BANKS
c22c0211-head THE DEVELOPMENT HAS LEFT SOME ANALYSTS WONDERING WHETHER THE BANK IS BEING AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING ITS RECORD OF SURPRISING LOAN PROBLEMS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS
c22c0212-head BUT BANK OFFICIALS SAID THEY ARE BEING PRUDENT
c22c0213-head THEY SAID LOWER WRITE OFFS REFLECT PREVIOUS HOUSECLEANING AS WELL AS MORE CONSERVATIVE LENDING PRACTICES
c22c0214-head IN ADDITION THE BANK HAS A BEEFED UP TEAM OF SPECIALISTS WHO ARE HAVING INCREASING SUCCESS IN RECOVERING PREVIOUSLY WRITTEN OFF LOANS
c22c0215-head I TOLD THEM THEY SHOULDN'T SIGN THE DEAL AND I HAD EVERYBODY MAD AT ME SAYS THE ATTORNEY
c22c0216-head BUT YOU CAN'T TELL ME YOU COULDN'T GET A REPUTABLE PERSON TO DO THAT WORK FOR CONSIDERABLY LESS
c22c0217-head ONCE YOU'RE PROMISING SOMEONE A SUM THAT HE CAN'T POSSIBLY JUSTIFY IN TERMS OF LEGITIMATE COSTS AND A PROFIT THERE'S A PRESUMPTION HE'S GOING TO MAKE ILLEGAL PAYMENTS
c22c0218-head AS SHE SPEAKS A CLERK FILLS A NEARBY BIN WITH LEMONS IN PLASTIC BAGS
c22c0219-head INSTANTLY SHE'S MOBBED
c22c021a-head A WOMAN GRABS FIVE BAGS

c22c021f-head LAW OFFICIALS FROM THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND SEVERAL STATES HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE OPENING INQUIRIES INTO AUDI'S REBATES
c22c021g-head OTHER LARGE AND MIDSIZED CARS POSTING GOOD SCORES WERE THE MERCURY SABLE THE OLDSMOBILE DELTA EIGHTY EIGHT AND THE BUICK REGAL
c22c021h-head THREE CARS IN THE CATEGORY PERFORMED POORLY POSTING SCORES ABOVE ONE THOUSAND FOR THE DRIVER'S SIDE
c22c021i-head THEY WERE THE BUICK PARK AVENUE THE CHRYSLER NEW YORKER AND THE RENAULT MEDALLION
c22c021j-head ALL THE CARS TESTED WERE FOUR DOOR VEHICLES EXCEPT THE BUICK
c22c021k-head NEW CAMPAIGN CO CHAIRMAN LAXALT MAY SERVE AS INTERMEDIARY WITH THE REAGANS EVEN AFTER EIGHT YEARS BUSH STILL FEELS AWKWARD TALKING TO THEM
c22c021l-head SOME STRATEGISTS THINK REAGAN'S RECENT RASH OF PATENTLY PARTISAN MOVES HAS BEEN A MISTAKE
c22c021m-head ONE EXPLANATION THE DESIRE OF CHIEF OF STAFF DUBERSTEIN EARLIER VIEWED AS A DOLE SUPPORTER TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH BUSH
c22c021n-head NE WIN'S SINGLE PARTY POLITICAL SYSTEM LONG HAS BEEN UNPOPULAR BUT IT HAS REMAINED IN POWER LARGELY BECAUSE OF MILITARY SUPPORT
c22c021o-head IN HIS TWENTY SIX YEAR RULE NE WIN TRANSFORMED BURMA FROM ONE OF SOUTHEAST ASIA'S RICHEST SOCIETIES TO ONE OF THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES
c22c021p-head UNDER HIS BURMESE WAY TO SOCIALISM THE STATE TOOK CONTROL OF ALMOST ALL ASPECTS OF ECONOMIC POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE
c22c021q-head THE LATEST PROBLEMS INCLUDE WHAT A SPOKESWOMAN SAID WERE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES DELAYING PRODUCTION AT THE COMPANY'S V. T. C. INCORPORATED CHIP MAKING UNIT
c22c021r-head SHE SAID PRODUCTION WAS RUNNING APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS BEHIND SCHEDULE FOR MANUFACTURING OF THE HIGH PERFORMANCE INTEGRATED CHIPS
c22c021s-head SOME CHIPS ARE BEING PRODUCED BUT NOT AT THE DESIRED RATE SHE SAID
c22c021t-head QUAKER OATS UP ONE AND ONE HALF UP ONE HALF FIFTY SIX
c22c021u-head BREAKUP VALUE SIXTY FIVE DOLLARS TO SEVENTY DOLLARS

c22c021y-head MR. RAMEY SAYS ITS CEREAL BUSINESS COULD HELP PHILLIP MORRIS'S STRUGGLING POST BRANDS
c22c021z-head THE WASHINGTON BASED RALES GROUP FIRST MADE A MERGER PROPOSAL FOR INTERCO AT SIXTY FOUR DOLLARS IN LATE JULY
c22c0220-head INTERCO WHICH MAKES CONVERSE ATHLETIC SHOES LONDON FOG RAIN GEAR AND ETHAN ALLEN FURNITURE REJECTED THE OFFER AND PUSHED ITS OWN REORGANIZATION AND RECAPITALIZATION PLAN
c22c0221-head THE RALES BROTHERS LAUNCHED THEIR HOSTILE TENDER OFFER IN MID AUGUST
c22c0222-head THE DEPUTY TREASURER DID IT SAYS FRANK KEEFE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MASTERMIND
c22c0223-head HE OBVIOUSLY MUST BE DOING IT BECAUSE IT IS A PRUDENT AND PROFESSIONAL THING TO DO
c22c0224-head AS FOR HIMSELF MR. KEEFE RECENTLY ANNOUNCED HE'S LEAVING HIS POST IN DECEMBER
c22c0225-head BY THEN THE LEGISLATURE WHICH RECONVENES TODAY TO PICK UP THE BUDGET MESS WILL BE PLAYING WHAT DID THE GOVERNOR KNOW AND WHEN DID HE KNOW IT
c22c0226-head WHAT POSSIBLE EFFECT THE VARIANT C. D. FOUR COULD HAVE ON GENENTECH'S COMPETITIVE POSITION OR PATENT POSITION IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT
c22c0227-head MARK RATNER BIOTECHNOLOGY'S SENIOR EDITOR FOR FINANCIAL COVERAGE SPECULATES IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S AMENDABLE WITHOUT PREJUDICE
c22c0228-head BESIDES HE ADDS THE WRONG MOLECULE COULD WORK AS WELL AS THE RIGHT MOLECULE
c22c0229-head UNTIL IT GOES THROUGH TRIALS NO ONE KNOWS
c22c022a-head HE SAID PRICE INCREASES SO FAR IN THE CURRENT QUARTER MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR INCREASING RAW MATERIAL COSTS ESPECIALLY IN THE ETHYLENE OXIDE BUSINESS
c22c022b-head CARBIDE'S CHIEF DERIVATIVE FROM ETHYLENE OXIDE ETHYLENE GLYCOL IS USED IN ANTI FREEZE AND POLYESTER FIBER
c22c022c-head SHIPMENTS ALSO ARE HOLDING UP WELL SO FAR THOUGH THEY ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE FOR SEASONAL REASONS AFTER THANKSGIVING HE SAID
c22c022d-head NOT TO WORRY IT ADDS BECAUSE MAJOR CARRIERS BY CONTROLLING ROUTES AND MAJOR HUBS AREN'T AS VULNERABLE AS PREVIOUSLY TO COMPETITION
c22c022e-head THEY ALSO HAVE HIDDEN SALABLE ASSETS SUCH AS AIRPORT GATES LANDING SLOTS ROUTES AND PLANES
c22c022f-head THEY MANAGE FARE STRUCTURES MORE EFFICIENTLY
c22c022g-head AND THEY BENEFIT FROM HIGH OPERATING LEVERAGE
c22c022h-head FOR EXAMPLE SALOMON SAYS A HALF PENNY INCREASE IN YIELD PER REVENUE PASSENGER MILE WOULD BOOST UNITED'S OPERATING INCOME BY THREE HUNDRED SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS
c22c022i-head BUT THE LAWMAKERS ACTUALLY SPENT ONLY ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF THE MONEY AUTHORIZED UNDER THE LEGISLATION THIS FISCAL YEAR
c22c022j-head AND SO FAR HARDLY ANY OF THE PROMISED ADDITIONAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN FORTHCOMING

c25c0229-head BUT THE A. C. L. U. HAS RELIED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF ITS HISTORY ON REPUBLICAN SUPPORT AND HAS ALLIED ITSELF WITH REPUBLICANS ON NUMEROUS ISSUES
c25c022a-head IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
c25c022b-head MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT

c25c022d-head LIBERALS LED A ROYAL COMMISSION THAT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE ENDORSED FREE TRADE AS THE BEST WAY FOR CANADA TO REACH ITS ECONOMIC POTENTIAL
c25c022e-head LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE
c25c022f-head WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
c25c022g-head MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
c25c022h-head BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF RICO THAN FROM REAL FELONS

c26c020f-head BUT SCIENCE STILL IS COUNTING THE BENEFITS FOR THOSE WHO ARE
c26c020g-head INDEED MANY OF THE MALADIES OF AGING CAN BE REVERSED AS WITH OSTEOPOROSIS THE LOSS OF BONE STRENGTH THAT PARTICULARLY PLAGUES OLDER WOMEN
c26c020h-head STUDIES SHOW A GAIN IN BONE MASS AMONG OLDER PEOPLE IN EXERCISE PROGRAMS

c26c020v-head AN EMBITTERED MR. PERRAULT LEFT THREE MONTHS LATER
c26c020w-head WHAT I AM SUGGESTING GENTLEMEN IS THAT THE PROCESS HAS NOT WOR(KED)-
c26c020x-head IT HAS BEEN INDISCREET ON BOTH ENDS OF PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE
c26c020y-head IF I HAD DIVULGED WHAT I WAS DOING MANY MANY LIVES WERE AT STAKE
c26c020z-head MOST OF THE DAMAGE TO STOCK PRICES CAME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AS BOND PRICES SAGGED ADDING FUEL TO THE FIRE OF INTEREST RATE FEARS

c26c021d-head YESTERDAY PEOPLE CLOSE TO FEDERATED'S BOARD SAID THAT THE COMPANY WAS STILL OPEN TO YET ANOTHER FRIENDLY MERGER PROPOSAL FROM CAMPEAU

c26c021o-head BUT IN MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN HE ARRIVED FOR DEBT TALKS IN MANHATTAN IN GOOD SPIRITS
c26c021p-head HOPING TO TRANSFORM THE STATIST PHILIPPINES INTO ASIA'S NEXT TIGER ECONOMY HE SERENADED HIS NEGOTIATING TEAM WITH THE OLD MELODY WE'RE ALMOST THERE
c26c021q-head ALTHOUGH INFLATION HAS SLOWED INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC DEMAND ECONOMISTS NOW BELIEVE A WIDELY PREDICTED DEEP RECESSION HAS BEEN AVOIDED
c26c021r-head INDEED A POWERFUL EXPORT BOOM ILLUSTRATING ONCE AGAIN THAT BRAZILIAN INDUSTRY IS GEARED TO SELL ABROAD AND ADJUST RAPIDLY IS FUELING A MILD RECOVERY
c26c021s-head IF INFLATION DOESN'T GO ANY HIGHER ANALYSTS BELIEVE THIS COULD BE MAINTAINED
c26c021t-head THIS WAS ROUGH ON ALL DEBTORS DOMESTIC AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL
c26c021u-head BUT NO ONE PROPOSED SOLUTIONS FOR DOMESTIC DEBTORS AS GRAND AS THOSE OFFICIALLY OFFERED FOR THE THIRD WORLD DEBTORS
c26c021v-head THE FIRST PART OF THE OFFICIAL PROPOSAL WAS TO REDUCE THE INTEREST BURDEN OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
c26c021w-head SECOND PROMOTE WORLD ECONOMIC RECOVERY

c26c021y-head MR. LLOYD SAYS HE HAS STARTED SELLING OFF HIS HOLDINGS TOO IN LINE WITH A FAMILY DECISION SIX MONTHS AGO
c26c021z-head BUT DON'T THINK FOR A MINUTE THAT HE'S LOSING INTEREST

c26c0221-head THE MEN WERE UNDETERRED BY HIS GRANDFATHERLY LOOKS
c26c0222-head SO HE REACHED INTO HIS CAR FOR HIS GUN AND TOLD THEM TO GET LOST

c26c0226-head NOW STUNG BY THE RECENT DEBT LADEN TAKEOVERS SOME FUND MANAGERS ARE PLANNING TO DUMP INDUSTRIAL BONDS
c26c0227-head OTHERS WILL REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO THEM
c26c0228-head WHAT MANY ARE BUYING INSTEAD BONDS ISSUED BY UTILITIES BANKS AND FOREIGN COMPANIES THOSE WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF BEING BOUGHT OUT
c26c0229-head OTHERS ARE BUYING SAFER TREASURY BONDS WHOSE YIELDS ARE A PERCENTAGE OR LESS BELOW TOP GRADE INDUSTRIAL DEBT
c26c022a-head A. YES WITHOUT QUESTION
c26c022b-head IT'S MY SENSE THAT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN PEOPLE THOUGHT THEY COULD TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION WITH ABSOLUTE IMPUNITY
c26c022c-head AND THAT'S NO LONGER TRUE
c26c022d-head NOW I AM CERTAIN THAT THERE ARE STILL PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY CAN TRADE ON INSIDE INFORMATION AND GET AWAY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE SMARTER THAN THE AVERAGE PERSON
c26c022e-head THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE PEOPLE
c26c022f-head BUT I THINK THAT THE ACTIONS HAVE HAD A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON CONDUCT
c26c022g-head MR. YEUTTER MEANWHILE SAID THE U. S. IS STILL VIGOROUSLY OPPOSED TO THE E. C.'S CALL FOR A REBALANCING OF TARIFFS ON FARM PRODUCTS
c26c022h-head IN EXCHANGE FOR ACCEPTING SOME TARIFF REDUCTIONS THE COMMUNITY WANTS TO BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE TARIFFS ON PRODUCTS THAT CURRENTLY ENTER THE E. C. DUTY FREE
