c1kc020i-head THE BEST CASE IS MADE BY ELECTRIC UTILITIES THAT HAVE POWER PLANTS SERVED BY COAL HAULING ROADS BUT BIG UTILITIES DON'T LACK BARGAINING POWER
c1kc020j-head FOR ONE THING THE STAGGERS ACT NOW ALLOWS LONG TERM CONTRACTS BETWEEN SHIPPERS AND RAILROADS
c1kc020k-head THAT INCREDIBLY WAS NOT ALLOWED UNDER THE OLD LAW BECAUSE CONGRESS HAD ONCE DECIDED THAT VOLUME DISCOUNTS TO BIG SHIPPERS WERE UNFAIR

c1kc0211-head THERE ARE MANY REASONS FOR THE NEW STRENGTH IN THE SWEDISH ECONOMY
c1kc0212-head SOME OF THEM CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ECONOMIC POLICIES PURSUED BY OUR GOVERNMENT WHICH IS LED BY THE SOCIAL DEMOCRATIC PARTY
c1kc0213-head SOME OF THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE DUE TO THE RAPID GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY AND THE HALVING OF OIL PRICES
c1kc0214-head THE IMPROVEMENT HAS GIVEN SWEDISH POLITICIANS TIME TO CONSIDER WHAT CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN A LONGER PERSPECTIVE TO ENSURE A CONTINUATION OF A FAVORABLE ECONOMIC SITUATION

c1kc021p-head AT FIRST F. D. I. C. OFFICIALS SUGGESTED THAT WOULD LEAVE CREDITORS EMPTY HANDED
c1kc021q-head BUT THAT CAME TO LOOK UNLIKELY AS FIRST CITY HAD SOME HEALTHY BANKS AND REGULATORS CAN CLOSE ONLY INSOLVENT BANKS
c1kc021r-head IF THEY HAD TAKEN OVER THE SICK BANKS CREDITORS MANY OF THEM ARBITRAGERS WHO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PROFIT COULD HAVE PURSUED CLAIMS AGAINST THE SOLVENT ONES
