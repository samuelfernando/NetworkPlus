c0vc021a-head IT IS CONCEIVABLE AT SOME POINT THAT THE THING COULD BEGIN TO MUSHROOM HE SAID
c0vc021b-head IF THAT HAPPENS THEN WHAT HAS GOT TO BE DONE TO PRESERVE THE ECONOMY AND PREVENT IT FROM BREAKING APART IS DANGEROUSLY HIGH INTEREST RATES

c0vc021r-head SO BEIJING OFFICIALS REPORTEDLY TALK OF TYING WAGES TO INFLATION AN IDEA REMINISCENT OF THE WAGE INDEXATION TRIED IN SOME LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS SEVERAL YEARS AGO WITH DISASTROUS RESULTS

c21c022g-head MORE THAN SIXTY BALLOT MEASURES RANGING FROM OPEN PIT MINING TO GOVERNMENT ETHICS TO PAROLE REFORM WILL CONFRONT VOTERS IN MORE THAN HALF THE STATES
c21c022h-head WHY THE EXPLOSION IN DIRECT DEMOCRACY
c21c022i-head A BIG REASON WE SUSPECT IS THAT LEGISLATORS ARE INCREASINGLY UNABLE OR UNWILLING TO DEAL WITH ISSUES THAT VOTERS CONSIDER IMPORTANT

c22c020f-head IT'S UNCLEAR HOWEVER WHETHER THE TARGET COMPANY WILL SET A PATTERN SETTLEMENT BECAUSE FORD IS FAR MORE PROFITABLE THAN G. M.

c25c021r-head HIS LATE FATHER WAS A FACTORY WORKER MAKING CHEAP METAL PLATED TROPHIES HIS MOTHER WAS A HOUSEWIFE
c25c021s-head ALL THIS REFLECTS A MOOD OF TRANSITION AND UNCERTAINTY THAT HAS GRIPPED BRITAIN'S PUBLICLY SUBSIDIZED THEATER IN RECENT YEARS
c25c021t-head FRETTING ABOUT FINANCES MOST COMPANIES ARE TAKING FEWER CREATIVE RISKS
c25c021u-head AUDIENCES IN TURN HAVE GROWN MORE CONSERVATIVE
c25c021v-head YET THERE'S MORE WORK PERFORMED NOW THAN IN YEARS MAINLY TO KEEP REVENUES FLOWING
c25c021w-head A BIG PART OF THE REASON FOR WOOD'S SUCCESS IS THE NEW TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS FOR WOOD PANELS WITH A STEEL CORE
c25c021x-head BESIDES NARROWING THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WOOD AND METAL SYSTEMS THESE TECHNIQUES PROVIDED THE PRECISION NEEDED IN DESIGNING PANEL SYSTEMS THAT MUST FIT TOGETHER

c25c022a-head IN THE CURRENT CONTROVERSY SOME REPUBLICANS ARE TRYING TO MINIMIZE THEIR PAST INVOLVEMENT
c25c022b-head MR. TURNER MAY EVEN KNOW ALL THIS BECAUSE HIS PROTECTIONIST ARDOR IS QUITE RECENT

c25c022e-head LIKE RICHARD GEPHARDT AND SOME OTHER U. S. DEMOCRATS MR. TURNER MUST BELIEVE PROTECTIONISM IS A HOT BUTTON TO POLITICAL OFFICE
c25c022f-head WHY THIS INCREDIBLE DIVERSION OF EFFORT TO CRIMES THAT OFTEN ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED BY STATUTE AND WHERE IDENTIFIABLE VICTIMS ARE SELDOM FOUND
c25c022g-head MAYBE TOO MANY OF TODAY'S PROSECUTORS WERE INFLUENCED BY THE PREVAILING COUNTERCULTURE SUSPICIONS OF MIDDLE CLASS MORALITY DURING THEIR LAW SCHOOL DAYS
c25c022h-head BUT ANOTHER ANSWER IS SIMPLER IT IS EASIER TO EXTRACT PLEA BARGAINS FROM TRADERS WITH A MERE MENTION OF RICO THAN FROM REAL FELONS

c2ac0212-head IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT NO PLAN TO RESTORE STABILITY TO WORLD MARKETS CAN SUCCEED WITHOUT ADDRESSING DOLLAR VOLATILITY
