c3yc020l-head WHAT ISN'T KNOWN IS THAT SANCTIONS HAVE COST JUST TWO SMALL PARTS OF THE U. S. ECONOMY MORE THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE
c3yc020m-head F. C. A. CONFIRMED THAT IT HAS REACHED A TENTATIVE SETTLEMENT OF CLASS ACTION SHAREHOLDER LITIGATION STEMMING FROM THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL PROBLEMS SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY THREE
c3yc020n-head THE COMPANY SAID IT REDUCED A RESERVE FOR SUCH A SETTLEMENT TO EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS
c3yc020o-head THE REDUCTION IN THE RESERVE AMOUNT ALSO REDUCED THE FIRST QUARTER NET LOSS BY SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS
c3yc020p-head THERE ARE TWO ISSUES TO CONSIDER
c3yc020q-head FIRST WHAT WAS ADMIRAL POINDEXTER'S BELIEF ABOUT THE PRESIDENT'S POLICY OF HELPING THE NICARAGUAN DEMOCRATIC RESISTANCE
c3yc020r-head SECOND DID ADMIRAL POINDEXTER BELIEVE WHAT HE AND COLONEL NORTH WERE DOING WAS LEGAL
c3yc020s-head BUT THE FED IS ALSO UNDER INTENSE POLITICAL PRESSURE TO AVOID RAISING INTEREST RATES BEFORE THE NOVEMBER PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION
c3yc020t-head ALL SIX FED GOVERNORS WERE APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT REAGAN AND FED CHAIRMAN ALAN GREENSPAN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
c3yc020u-head FED OFFICIALS ALSO WORRY THAT SHARPLY HIGHER INTEREST RATES COULD DAMAGE STILL WEAK SEGMENTS OF THE ECONOMY AND EXACERBATE PROBLEMS AMONG TROUBLED BANKS AND THRIFT INSTITUTIONS
c3yc020v-head CERTAIN PRICES HAVE RISEN AT A BRISK PACE THROUGHOUT THIS DECADE
c3yc020w-head HEALTH CARE INFLATION FOR INSTANCE HASN'T DROPPED BELOW SIX PERCENT ANNUALLY AND THE COST OF EDUCATION HAS RISEN EVEN FASTER
c3yc020x-head BUT UNTIL RECENTLY INFLATION IN HEALTH EDUCATION AND OTHER SERVICES WAS OFFSET BY FLAT OR FALLING PRICES FOR MANY MANUFACTURED GOODS AND FARM COMMODITIES
c3yc020y-head THE DECLINE IN THE DOLLAR AND THE CONTINUED STRENGTH IN THE ECONOMY HOWEVER ARE NOW ADDING DEMAND AND CAUSING THOSE PRICES TO RISE TOO
c3yc020z-head A DROP IN OIL PRICES COULD ALSO PROVIDE SOME PRICE RELIEF AS IT DID IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX
c3yc0210-head THE RECENT FAILURE OF THE ORGANIZATION OF PETROLEUM EXPORTING COUNTRIES TO REACH AN AGREEMENT LIMITING PRODUCTION SUGGESTS PRICES MIGHT FALL SOME
c3yc0211-head BUT ANY DIP IN INFLATION ASSOCIATED WITH OIL PRICES IS LIKELY TO BE TEMPORARY
c3yc0212-head L. T. V. WILL PRESENT THE PLAN TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF ITS BANK AND CREDITOR COMMITTEES NEXT WEEK
c3yc0213-head BUT THE PLAN WON'T BE FILED WITH THE BANKRUPTCY COURT UNTIL THE CREDITORS AND L. T. V. AGREE ON HOW THE DEBT WILL BE PAID
c3yc0214-head THAT COULD TAKE YEARS
c3yc0301-head INVESTMENT BANKERS SAID IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET MANY DIFFERENT ISSUERS INVESTORS DEALERS AND CUSTODIANS TO AGREE ON A SINGLE BOOK ENTRY METHOD
c3yc0302-head IN ADDITION ONE BANKER SAID THAT A BOOK ENTRY SYSTEM RAISED LEGAL QUESTIONS ABOUT LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN ISSUER'S DEFAULT
c3yc0303-head OTHERS SAID THAT COMMERCIAL BANKS THAT ACT AS CUSTODIANS DIDN'T WANT TO SURRENDER THE LUCRATIVE FEES ASSOCIATED WITH HANDLING PHYSICAL SECURITIES
c3yc0304-head BUT SO CAREFULLY HIDDEN IS MR. MARCOS WEALTH THAT INVESTIGATORS STILL CAN ONLY GUESS AT ITS SIZE
c3yc0305-head SOME OF HIS INVESTMENTS MAY NEVER BE FOUND BECAUSE THEY ARE ADROITLY DISGUISED AND BURIED IN LAYERS OF OWNERSHIP
c3yc0306-head SOME OF THE CASES BEING PREPARED AGAINST HIM MAY NEVER COME TO TRIAL BECAUSE THEY ARE POLITICALLY TROUBLESOME
c3yc0307-head MARCOS LOYALISTS REMAIN ENTRENCHED IN THE GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY AND CAN STYMIE THE INVESTIGATION AND THEY ARE SO POWERFUL IN BUSINESS THAT THEY STILL LARGELY CONTROL THE ECONOMY
c3yc0308-head IN A TELEVISION INTERVIEW MR. MAXWELL SAID HE WANTS TO ACQUIRE GUINNESS PEAT LOCK STOCK AND BARREL ACCORDING TO MR. JAY
c3yc0309-head HE ADDED THAT MR. MAXWELL WOULD LIKE TO DO IT WITH THE AGREEMENT OF GUINNESS PEAT'S BOARD
c3yc030a-head MR. JAY DECLINED TO SAY WHEN AN OFFER WOULD BE MADE OR WHETHER MR. MAXWELL WOULD LAUNCH A HOSTILE BID
c3yc030b-head MR. JAY SAID THE PUBLISHER WAS TRAVELING AND UNAVAILABLE FOR COMMENT
c3yc030c-head IN SINGAPORE SHARE PRICES CLIMBED IN LIGHT TRADING IN LINE WITH OTHER REGIONAL BOURSES PARTLY ON HOPE OF AN AGREEMENT TO CUT THE U. S. BUDGET DEFICIT
c3yc030d-head THE RECOVERY IN SINGAPORE REMAINS UNCERTAIN BROKERS SAID
c3yc030e-head LOCAL INSTITUTIONS DID MOST OF THE BUYING IN BLUE CHIP ISSUES AND FOREIGN PLAYERS WERE STILL CONSPICUOUSLY ABSENT
c3yc030f-head BANKS AND STOCK EXCHANGE OFFICIALS ESTIMATED THAT IT WOULD TAKE FIVE MILLION DOLLARS TO SAVE THE FIRM
c3yc030g-head BUT WHEN I GOT INTO IT IT WAS THE WORST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS MR. PEROT SAYS
c3yc030h-head AFTER THREE YEARS HE SAYS I GOT TIRED OF FEEDING IT
c3yc030i-head I'M TELLING YOU THERE IS NO WORK FOR WHITES IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY
